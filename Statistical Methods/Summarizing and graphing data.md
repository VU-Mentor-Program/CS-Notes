An example of graphical summary is the **histogram**. It consists of bars whose heights are equal to the numbers of measurements in the corresponding intervals.
Choose a summary most suitable for the research question. Often, we are interested in the data distribution. A good summary shows:
- The characteristics of data distribution: location, spread, range, extremes, accumulations, gaps, symmetry,. . .
Depending on the context and goal:
- Data sampled from a certain distribution?
- Different groups needed for further analysis? I 
- Influences of other variables, e.g. time?
- Dependence between variables?

# Graphical summaries
Summarize → describe/find structure in data distribution: 
- **Graphical**: tables, graphs, other figures
- **Descriptive**
	- **Qualitative**: describe shape, location and dispersion/variation 
	- **Quantitative**: numerical summaries of location and variation

First step in every data analysis: if possible, make figures of data for own use → right choice of statistical methods.

Possible graphical summaries (not all applicable to all types of data): 
- Frequency distribution (table)
- Bar chart
- Pareto bar chart
- Pie chart 
- Histogram 
- Time series

Histograms depend on choices of the number of cells (intervals) and bin locations. We must choose reasonable dimensions, scale, title and axes labels when presenting a graph.
In the case below, the graphs on the bottom are better suited, since you can more easily distinguish the difference in scale.
