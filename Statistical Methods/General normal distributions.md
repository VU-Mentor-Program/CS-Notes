If random variable $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$, then $Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\sim N(0,1)$. We can now calculate the probability of $X$ with values from the normal standard distribution.

> [!example] $X\sim N(10,25)$
> Since $$Z=\frac{X-10}{5}\sim N(0,1)$$ $$\Rightarrow P(X\geq 8)=P\left(\frac{X-10}{5}\geq \frac{8-10}{5}\right)=P(Z\geq -0.4)$$
# Applications of normal distributions
Let $x$ be a value of interest, related to a population distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. The *$z$ score of* $x$ is $z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$. -> It is the number of standard deviations away from the mean. In layman's terms, it's the value on the normal standard distribution which will have the same probability as $x$ has in $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$.
