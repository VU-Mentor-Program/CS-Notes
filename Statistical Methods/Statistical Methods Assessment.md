Let $A$ be the average grade for the assignments, $M$ be the midterm exam grade, $F$ be the final exam grade, $R$ be the resit grade. The exam grade is computed as $E=(4M+5F)/9$ or $E=R$ if the student participated in the resit. Then the total score $S$ is computed as $0.25*A+0.75*E$ if $E\geq5.5$, or $min\{0.25*A+0.75*E,5\}$ if $E<5.5$. The final course grade $F$ will be the score $S$ rounded to the nearest multiple of $\frac{1}{2}$ if $S\geq 6$; or rounded to the nearest integer if $S<6$.
