If **$\sigma^2$ is unknown**, it is estimated by the sample standard variance $S_n^2$. Then, approximately, under $H_0$, $$T=\frac{\bar X_{n}-\mu}{S_{n} / \sqrt{n}}\sim t_{n-1}$$
This is the **t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom**. If we want to then find the critical values for a t-distribution, we need to find the upper t-quantile, where $P(T\geq t_{n-1,\alpha})=\alpha$

> [!info] Critical regions for tests with sample size $n$ and significance level $\alpha$ 
> - Left-sided test: critical region to the left of $-t_{n-1,\alpha}$
>   -> $(-\infty,-t_{n-1,\alpha})$
> - Right-sided test: critical region to the right of $t_{n-1,\alpha}$
>   -> $(t_{n-1,\alpha},+\infty)$
> - Two-sided test: critical region is $(-\infty,-t_{n-1,\alpha/2}) \cup (t_{n-1,\alpha/2},+\infty)$

In addition to this, we can create [[Estimating a Population Mean|Confidence Intervals]]. If we **know $\sigma$** we replace $s_n$ with it for the confidence interval. However, when we **do not know $\sigma$**, instead of using $z$-scores we use a *t-distribution*: $$\left[\bar x_{n} - t_{n-1,\alpha/2} \frac{s_{n}}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar x_{n} + t_{n-1,\alpha/2} \frac{s_{n}}{\sqrt{n}}\right]$$
