**Course material**

The main reference for the course is the textbook

_Elementary Statistics_, 12th edition (Pearson New International Edition), by Mario Triola, ISBN: 9781292039411.

There are multiple digital copies of the book available online on the VU library website. There is also a physical copy at the library (next day return). The book can also be bought at STORM.

Some alternative sources are given on page [Some more statistics and R sources](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/some-statistics-and-r-online-sources?wrap=1 "Some statistics and R online sources").

Course content consists in the material of 10 lectures; the corresponding parts of the textbook (see below) are provided on the page  [Course schedule](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/course-schedule "Course schedule"). The slides of each lecture are available on Canvas under [Course material](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/modules/192841 "Course material") before (or shortly after) the corresponding lecture. The lecture slides contain all essential theory for this course. Recordings from previous years may be made available in [Videorecordings from previous years](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/modules/192838?wrap=1 "Videorecordings from previous years"), but the content is not guaranteed to be equal to the material of this year, and _the recordings cannot serve as a full substitute of the lectures_. 

**Practicums (practical classes) and tutorials**

- Practicums are intended for your group to work on assignments. During the practicums, your TA will assist your group in the ongoing assignment or/and explain something general to the whole audience. Keep in mind that groups work independently on the assignments, and the TA's are not supposed to give you solutions of ongoing and future assignments, but rather provide you with hints and answers to the general questions on the course material. 
- The aim of tutorials is to help you better understand the lecture material and solve theoretical exercises under guidance of a TA. Making theoretical exercises is indispensable for preparing for exams. During tutorial, you make exercises over the material treated in the lecture(s) before the tutorial(s). Exercises can be discussed in a (small) group and/or explained by the TA to a group. The tentative schedule for the tutorials (and exercises) is given in [Course schedule](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/course-schedule "Course schedule").
- Information about the distribution over the classrooms/timeslots can be found on page [Course schedule](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/course-schedule "Course schedule").

**Assignments  
**

- Three assignments will be posted on Canvas in due time. The tentative schedule for assignments is given in [Course schedule](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/course-schedule "Course schedule").
- Each assignment is to be made and submitted in **groups of 3 students**. You must first enroll in an _assignment group_ in canvas page [People/Assignment groups](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/users "People") in order to be able to upload your (group) assignment report.  If you wish to work together with someone specific, make sure to enroll together in one assignment group on Canvas before the first practical class.
- Students from the previous year (who did all the assignments but did not do/pass the exam) are allowed to carry over their assignment grades to this year. The students who opt for this transfer must enroll in the (big) group "_Assignments grades from previous year_" in  [People/Previous year assignment grades](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/users "People"). In due time we will transfer their assignment grades from the record of the previous year.
- Students without group will be randomly distributed over available groups right before the first practicum. Around the deadline for Assignment 1, the _self-enroll_ option for assignment groups will be disabled and the assignment groups will be fixed afterwards.
- Before writing your report, **please read carefully** the page [Guidelines for assignments](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/guidelines-for-assignments?wrap=1 "Guidelines for assignments").
- There is **no retake** possible for the assignments.
- Grading of some assignments may not be completed before the exams.
- The assignments **require use** **of** **R**. The free statistical software package R can be downloaded from [www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org)

[Links to an external site.](http://www.r-project.org). You will also need RStudio, a useful IDE for R, downloadable from [www.rstudio.com](http://www.rstudio.com)

- [Links to an external site.](http://www.rstudio.com). Make sure that you have installed R and RStudio (this is your responsibility) before the first practicum. 
- Additional R-sources can be found on page [R-sources](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/r-sources "R-sources"). In particular, an _R Markdown_ template for your assignment reports can be found on page [R-sources](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/r-sources "R-sources").
- There is an auxiliary [Assignment 0](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/pages/assignment-0 "Assignment 0"), which is not to be submitted. You can start working on Assignment 0 right after you have installed R.  The purpose of this assignment is to get acquainted with R and R-Studio.  

**Exam(s)**

- The general rules around exams (Examination Regulations) are communicated by the Beta faculty as general Canvas announcement, exam grades from previous years are not transferable.
- There will be digital (within TestVision system) midterm exam (covering material of Lectures 1-5, tentative planned duration 1:45 hours), digital final exam (material of Lectures 6-10, tentative duration 2:15 hours),  and one digital resit (material of Lectures (1-10, tentative duration 2:45 hours).
- In due time we provide practice midterm and final exams to prepare for the actual exams.  
- During the digital exam(s) it will be permitted to use 
    - scrap paper (surveillants are to bring scrap paper). The so called "digital scrap paper" will also be included to the tools of the digital exam, but you may prefer to use usual scrap paper. 
    - a calculator provided it is not part of a communicating device. The TestVision calculator will be included to tools of the digital exam, which is in principle enough as well.  
    - Formula sheet as one pdf-file in the instruction page of the TestVision exam. During the exam this file should be openable in a separate tab/window.
