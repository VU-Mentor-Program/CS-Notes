Practicums/tutorials will take place twice a week, first session on Tuesday/Wednesday and the second on Friday. In principle each student is registered for a certain practicum/tutorial group (marked as Groups 1-9 in the official schedule), but for now we will disregard this devision. When working on assignments, it may be handy (and it is recommended) to attend the same practicum together with the members of your assignment group. To provide this possibility (and flexibility in choosing your classes), practicum/tutorial groups are created in [Practicum/tutorial groups](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/users "People") in one of which you can enroll (and unenroll at any time) together with your teammates. Once enrolled in one of these groups (Groups 1-9), follow the practicum/tutorial schedule according to that group from the official schedule.

If you are not enrolled in one of the groups from  [Practicum/tutorial groups](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/users "People"), you can come to a class, but if the class is full, the priority will be given to the students which are enrolled (at that moment) in the practicum/tutorial group assigned to this class, see [pdf-file of the schedule Statistical Methods (X_401020)](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/files/6744628?wrap=1 "Timetable_StatMeth(X_401020).pdf")[](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/files/6744628/download?download_frd=1)

[Download pdf-file of the schedule Statistical Methods (X_401020)](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/files/6744628/download?download_frd=1). It makes sense for you and your teammates to register in an assignment group in [Assignment groups](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/users "People") on Canvas before the first practicum, and then register together with the whole assignment group in one of  [Practicum/tutorial groups](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71285/users "People").
