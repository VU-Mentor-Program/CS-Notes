# A brief introduction to e-commerce
- reduced cost and complexity of electronic connectivity lead to its growth
- Intenet allows for more ways of trading -> system-to-system trading, computer-mediated trading between companies and companies with individiuals
## Development of websites
- **Reduces cost of advertising**: 
	- attract new customers and retain existing ones with advertisment in marketplace
	- newspapers, magazines, television, radio, advertising boards, mailshots -> all very expensive
	- few thousand dollars for start-up
	- 24-hour access daily across the world
- **Cheaper and easier provision of information**: 
	- public services provide information -> cheaper ways to disperse information for the host organization
	- faster more convenient method of access for the public
	- governments and organizations provide extensive information services on the web
- **Ease of update**: 
	- easily update products, list of services, prices, etc.
- **Lack of need to maintain a shop front**:
	- user doesn't need to enter organization's premises
	- business can overcome capital investment in building to impress clients
	- user doesn't know if business is small or mulitnational -> small business can compete
- **The ease of crossing geographical boundries**:
	- world wide audience -> small business can market and sell products globally
- **The absence of the middleman**:
	- direct marketing without distributor and retailor -> however less service for customer
## Multi-channel commerce

- combine with other channels (some traditional)
	- most successful e-commerce ventures have traditional business background/infrastructure

^da1b78

Three categories of e-commerce systems:
1. **Electronic markets**:
	- Search for service or product
	- customers can examine alternatives and make comparisions between the services and prices
	- allows for provision of other information services
2. **Electronic data interchange**: 
	- Companies in regular dealings with other trading partners establish communications to process transactions carried out
	- standard protocal for encoding data exchange, sometimes permanent
3. **Internet commerce**: 
	- goods and services advertised
	- individual transactions are executed
	- business-to-business or business-to-customer (B2B and B2C)
# Conducting business over the Internet
- e-commerce pays no attention to time differences between countries
- products are more likely to be sold over the Internet:
	- browse over a range of products where touch prior to purchase is not needed
	- no advice is needed from the seller
	- the desired choice is known unambiguously by a title or specification
	- the range of products is large
	- the products can be dispatched easily
	- there would not be differences in the quality of the product between one seller and another
- marketplaces are more open and trading activities more diverse
- competitive advantage of e-commerce:
	- **Price competitiveness**: reduced transaction costs in automated ordering
	- **Timeliness**: Faster ordering, delivery and invoicing
	- **Knowledge of market**: new methods to acquire knowledge of the market in which they operate (customer profiles)
## The drivers for using the Internet for business
- **Cost**: low entry costs; web presence established relatively cheaply -> fast return on investment
- **Flexibility**: basic web presence or full-blown transaction-handling system (developed incrementally)
- **Protecting investment**: many open standards -> switching system is cheap
- **Connectivity and communications opportunities**: create new local intranet or video-conferencing links
- **Low risk**: technology is well understood with alot of participants
- **Improved customer service**: directed or focused marketing made easier
- **Globalization**: easier and lower cost route for companies to participate in global business activity
## Barriers to entry
- **Uncertainty over business models**: businesses reluctant to commit themselves to e-commerce when having an unappropriate structure
- **Telecommunications costs**: telephone communications cost is significant in underdeveloped countries
- **Bandwidth**: Internet access restricted by bottlenecks from Internet traffic
- **Security**: breaches in security pose risk to corporations (virus attacks and unauthorized intrusion)
- **Lack of clear standards**: different types of standards to implement
- **Law and legal frameworks**: many questions over legal issues (cross national trading) -> problem with location of customer, vendor and web server
- **Preparedness**: businesses cautious entering global marketplace until compeltely prepared
# Trade cycles and e-commerce
## Porter's five forces model and e-commerce
- **Threat of new entrants**: Competitors don't need to match IT infrastructure if they adapt a new 'leading edge' from fresh ideas (from rapid development of new technologies)
- **Threat of substitution**: introduction of substitute products (e.g. software, books and recorded music businesses)
- **Bargaining power of buyers**: increased information to customers poses similar threats to suppliers who may have faced much less intense competition in traditional markets
- **Bargaining power of suppliers**: EDI is a precondition to engaging in some industries in trades
- **Competition with rivals**: E-commerce solutions can reduce transaction costs, reduce stockholding, increase the reliability of supply and help to differentiate the company's product or service
