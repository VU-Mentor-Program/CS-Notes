# The increasing focus on business intelligence
> [!definition]+ Business intelligence
> *the result of applying tools and techniques to the data and information available within and without an organization to facilitate a better understanding of both its environment and its operation and thereby improve the decision-making process*

^0749fa

- take known facts and records available and further process and interrogate them to discover new information
- crosses over with *knowledge management* -> data already available to the organization is processed to produce information which in turn is futher analysed to produce new knowledge
## Key features of business intelligence
- **Internal and external inputs**: business intelligence utlizies raw data *and* draws from source external to the organization (competitor activity, governmental sources, supplier or customer activity or behaviour)
- **Structured and unstructured data**: derive from content or destination of e-mails, logs of browsing activity on websites, content of web pages 
- **Improved support for creating business strategy**: business strategy is based upon detailed and accurate information (provided by business intelligence)
- **Gaining competetive advantage**: gain advantage from understanding more about itself, environment and competitors
- **Improving support for decision making**: business intelligence can provide examples of similar decisions in the past or decisions by competitors -> based on *intelligence*, decisions can be made in the *design*, *choice* and *implementation* stages
- **Increasing the use of performance indicators**: non-profit-making sectors (authorities and health provision) don't have competition -> set goals and targets, use metrics to determine if it's successful -> business intelligence tools assist in taking actions to make sure if targets are achieved and to what degree
- **External drivers**: business intelligence tools provide knowledge and understanding to operate more transparently (endorsed by legislation concerning freedom of information, etc.)
# Business intelligence from analysing data and information
## Decision support systems (DDS)
> [!summary] 
> The trend in modern decision support systems is towards end-user involvment in the development of simple fragmented models targeted to aid, rather than replace, the kinds of decision to be made. Easy and flexible interactive access to data and modelling facilities is as likely to be provided by PCs and networks as by the more traditional large central computers.
### DSS support decisions
- intended to *support* rather than replace decisions
- decisions that have a structured computational and data transformation element, as well as an unstructured non-rule-governed component can be aided but not replaced by decision support systems
### DSSs involve flexible interactive access to data
- DSS designed with understanding of requirements of decision makers and decision-making process in mind
- interactive: semi-structured decisions involve decision maker in asking questions that require immediate answers
- flexible: decision maker has immediate access to ad hoc data-retrieval with query languages from corporate database
- **quick and easy availability of access to decision makers**
- database management systems provide data-retrieval facilities
- standard document structure for the web simplifies the presentation of information
### DSS are fragmented
- separate development of models to provide support for individual decisions or types of decision 
- no attempt to develop global comprehensive decision support model for entire organization
### Types of decision support system
1. **Data retrieval and analysis for decision support**:
	- Simple entry and enquiry systems: provide immediate interrogation of a database for specific enquiries (e.g. restocking?)
	- Data analysis system: provide summaries and reports of data held on database
	- Accounting information systems: analysis of accounting transaction data
2. **Computational support for structured decisions**:
	- use existing data held on database together with individual cases to arrive at information for a decision
3. **Decision support involving modelling**
	- use of data from database or user input (which might be hypothetical) to calculate consequences using a model that reflects relationships between variables, that are believed to be relevant for decision
## Digital dashboards
- provide information from various sources to a decision maker
- status of key variables for the company are shown together on one screen to senior executives to monitor the perfomance of the company -> more informed decision making
- provision of information in various ways using visual displays such as tables, graphs, charts, maps and gauges
- average number of different sources needed to make a decision ranged between six and ten
