> - explain how the [[Strategy and Information Systems#Competitive forces within an industry - five forces model|competitive forces analysis]] and [[Strategy and Information Systems#Internal stages of growth|internal stage analysis]] can be used to develop an information systems strategy
# The need for a business strategy
- individual departments in an organization may function well in terms of their own objectives but still not serve the objectives of the organization
	- lack of coordination between departments
	- different objectives
	- subsystem optimization leads to total system suboptimization
- occasional major resource allocations (purchase and development of new property and machines)
	- allocations need agreed direction for the organization
- organization has responsibilites to a number of different groups (owners, shareholders, investors, banks)
	- strategy needs to satisfy interests of partners
# Strategic business planning
- large organizations have strategies for future five year period
- some organizations need longer horizon (national defence, nuclear industry) -> developments are planned to fruition
- fast-changing environments need shorter period (high-technology industries)
- changes to strategy will be incremental (and on yearly basis)
## Determine the business mission and obejctives
- mission of organization consists of number of individual aims
- medium and long-term objectives should support overall mission
- each objective has measurable performance indicator to show success in meeting actual goal
## Identify the likely future performance against objectives
- continuous monitoring of performance against current objectives
	- forecasts of future sales, cash flows, material requirements

> [!tldr]
> current operations of the organization will have an implied future scenario, which can be compared with desired objectives
- **SWOT**: identify internal strengths, internal weaknesses, external oppurtunites, external threats -> estimate gap between future objectives and forecast future performance
## Develop the business strategy
- plans achieve its stated objectives by involving new projects, or continuing operation of existing activities
- business strategy has components: human resource strategy, information systems strategy, marketing strategy -> interact with one another
# Business information systems strategy
## Competitive forces within an industry - five forces model
- the way the business responds to these forces will determine it's success
- ![[An industry and its competitive forces.canvas]]
### Suppliers
- provide necessary inputs of raw materials, machinery and manufactured components
- bargaining power by pushing up prices with threat of taking supply goods elsewhere
- good relationships with supplier by using **electronic data interchange (EDI)** -> business make rival business unattractive for supplier
	- EDI: send structured electronic messages to supplier that are decoded to act appropriately
		- reduces delivery times
		- reduces paperwork and associated labour costs
		- increases accuracy of information
- very important for just-in-time approach e.g. car manufacturers and suppliers of component parts
### Customers
- power by threatening to purchase the product or service from a competitor
	- power large if few customers and many competitors
- introduce switching costs (apple -> android; less features)
	- allow the customer to have on-line ordering facilities for business' service or product
	- Ex: learning disincentive when switching electronic banking
- **Customer relationsihp management (CRM)**
	- customer profiling, developing categories of customer and attempting to predict their behaviour
### Subsitute products
- products or services within the industry but are differentiated in some way
- products meet needs of customer more closely -> switch to competitor
- use IMS to provide differentiated products swiftly using computer-aided design and manufacturing (make substitute product yourself)
### New entrants
- stop new companies from entering market and attracting demand of products of that industry -> reduce revenue of competitors
	- exploit economies of scale in production
	- creat brand loyalty
	- create legal barriers to entry (patents)
	- use effective production methods involving large capital outlays
- IMS help reduce labout costs and speed up production process -> attempted competitors are competitively disadvantaged without similar investment in capital
### Competitor rivalry
- unless it's a monopoly, any business is an industry has competitors -> threat and motivation to make better products
- close linkages with suppliers and customers produce competitive forces against rivals
- investments in technology for differentiated and cheaper to manufacter products
## Internal stages of growth
### The Nolan stage model
- extent and type of information systems used in an organization is determined by maturity of growth of information systesm within that organization
- six-stage growth model identifies which stage of growth characterized an organization's information systems maturity -> successful planning to proceed to next level of growth
	- expenditure on IT increases with the stages
	- each stage has four major growth processes that must be planned, managed and coordinated
		1. *Applications portfolio*: applications the IS must support (financial planning, order processing)
		2. *DP organization*: orientation of data processing
		3. *DP planning and control*: degree of control, formalization of planning process, management of projects
		4. *User awareness*: are users aware of and involved with technology
- **Six-stage Nolan model**
	1. **Initiation**: 
		- computerized low-level transaction processing (payroll, processing of accounting)
		- little planning of information system
		- users are unaware of technology
		- little systematic methodology in systems analysis and design
	2. **Contagion**:
		- awareness of IT increases without real understanding of benefits or limitations
		- more applications developed
		- little check on user requests for more applications
		- general managerial control over development of IS and budgetary control over IT low
		- maintenance of systems takes priority of IT
	3. **Control**
		- growing awareness of need to manage the IS function
		- data processing department reorganized
		- more projects -> user departments for project development and use of computer services
	4. **Integration**
		- data-processing geared towards information provision
		- introduction of interactive terminals
		- development of a database and introduction of data communications technologies
		- user departments satisfy demand for information support 
		- reliance on computer-based controls become ineffective (redundancy and duplication of data)
	5. **Data administration**
		- introduce controls on the proper administration of data
		- data is regarded as a resource in an organization (must be properly planned and managed) -> development of integrated database serving organizational needs
	6. **Maturity**
		- IS integral to the functioning of the organization
		- applications portfolio mirrors organizational activities
		- data structure becomes data model for organization
		- IS is planned comprehensively
- Model used as planning process to see what has to be achieved to move onto the next stage
- **Earl model**:
	- stages of growth apply to different technologies
	- new technological developments result in sudden increase in understanding (perpetual and refelced for each technology)
	- different parts of the organization may be at different points in the stages of growth
	- concentrates on task and objectives of planning at each stage
	- senior managers take role of planning information systems to link to business objectives
