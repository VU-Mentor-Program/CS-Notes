## The case study
- case studies are useful for understanding the process of systems analysis and design
# Statement of scope and objectives
- analysts don't have clear task if the project hasn't been 'taken off the ground'
- analyst must provide written statement of the scope and objectives of the project
	- what the analyst perceives to be the problems to which the systems project is addressed
- short rough estimate as a starting point so the analyst and management have an agreed understanding
# Systems investigation
- analyst hast to determine
	- the objectives of the existing system
	- how the existing system works
	- any legal, government or other regulations that might affect the operation of the system - for example, the Data protection Act
	- the economic and organizational environment within which the system lies and in particular any changes that are likely to occur
## The analyst's channels of information
Analyst obtains information from five main sources
- **Interviews**
	- complete overview with personnel at each level
	- improves experience
	- analyst must have clear purpose for each interview
	- analyst becomes familiar with technical terms, positions and general responsibilites of the interviewee
- **Documentation**
	- instruction manuals and procedures manuals provide a statement of the way that tasks are to be performed
	- job descriptions define responsibilities of personnel
	- company policy dictate overall objectives
- **Observation**
	- information gathering is direct but time-consuming
	- only by observation does the analyst see directly how activities are performed (not how they should be or how they are claimed to be performed)
- **Questionnaires**
	- questions are simple, unambiguous and unbiased
	- use multiple-choice
	- have clear idea of the information that is required from the questionnaire
	- questions are aimed at interest and intellect of respondents
- **Measuring**
	- statistical information about the workings of the existing system
	- specific patterns can be identified that tie with the success of the current system
## Approaching the investigation
- **Flow block diagram**
	- show important subsystems in an organization and the flows between them -> overview of system
- **Organization charts**
	- show various roles and their relationships within an organization
	- reflect relationships of control, decision flow and levels of managerial activity between elements of heirarchy
	- determine key personnel for interview
- **Task identification**
	- identify key tasks within each subsystem
	- task is a process for converting input into an output
	- Key questions that should be satisfied
		- what types of input are there? (structure, source, rate of input, patterns in provision)
		- what types of output are there? (structure, destination, rate of output, patterns of output, purpose)
		- what is the logic of the process?
		- What experience or training is necessary to become competent at it?
		- What level of accuracy is required?
		- What stores, files or records are consulted in performing the task? 
		- How often are these consulted?
		- What indexes or keys are used for selecting the correct record? 
		- How many records are in the available record store?
		- What types of control are exerted over the task?
		- Who is responsible for each control?
	- analyst should have understanding of:
		- who does what
		- where it is done
		- why it is done
		- when it is done
		- how it is done
# The feasibility study and report
- main purpose of systems investigation is to establish the feasiblity of introduction of a computer system
	- estimate of costs and benefits
## Economic feasibility
- **Economic costs**
	- Systems analysis and design
	- Purchase of hardware
	- Software costs
	- Training costs
	- Installation costs
	- Conversion and changeover costs
	- Redundancy costs
	- Operating costs
- **Economic benefits**
	- Savings in labour costs
	- Benefits due to faster processing
	- Better decision making
	- Better customer service
	- Error reduction
## Technical feasibility
A question of how much money an organization is prepared to invest in order to achieve a technical solution
- Rule-governed tasks: tasks undertaken are not governed by rules but require discretion and judgement
- Repetitive tasks: financialy most suitable to computerization
- Complex tasks: Can the task be broken down -> more desirable to computerize
- High degree of accuracy: computers outstrip human sin speed and low error rates if high degree of numerical accuracy is required
- Speed of response: computers are faster if designed to do so
- Data used for many tasks: data is easy and cheap to use repeatedly for different tasks
## Organizational feasibility
- does the organization have a history of acceptance of information technology? (absenteeism and high turnover from previous introduction of new technology?)
- will the personnel in the organizaiton be able to cope with operting the new technology? (staff of long established system won't adapt as quickly)
- is the organizational structure compatible with the proposed information system? (competing departments in an organization will unlikely lead to successful integrated system)
## Feasibility report
- principal work areas for the project will have been identified
- any needs for specialst staff to be involved in the later stages of the projct will have been noted
- possible improvement or potential for savings may have become apparent during the investigation
