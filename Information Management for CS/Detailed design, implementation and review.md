# Implementation
## Program development and testing
- program specifications for programmers to implement -> very costly
- structured analysis and design facilitates structured programming -> reduce programmming complexity and ensures reliability
- program testing is of critcal importance in the development of software
	- analyst specifies test plans
	- types of testing:
		- *random test data*
		- *logical test data*
		- *typical test data*
### Extreme programming
## Hardware acquisition and installation
- hardware required specified in systems specification
-  different suppliers make contract offers to business
- hardware purchased or leased
- installation of hardware is costly
## Training and staff development
- familirazation of staff with the skills necessary to operate the computer system to perform tasks
- lectures and seminars
- stimulation of the work environment
- on-the-job training with supervision of personnel
- software packages train personnel (tutorials)
## Data store conversion
- organization has historic data that must be entered into the files or database of the new computer system
- software converts input from old database and converts it into the format required
- decisions on what data should be imported
- data is transcribed on to intermediate documentation prior to data entry
