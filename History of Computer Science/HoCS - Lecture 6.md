# Computers in the movie industry
- Change in storage medium 
	- Celluloid - Magtape - DVD - Streaming
	- This changed the way in which people watch movies. Films became more widely available â—‹ This was disastrous for movie theatres, because people could watch at home
	- Cloud storage also shut down DVD rental stores
- Change in theme:
    - "2001" (1968) had a theme of space travel. The AI went berserk => fault in the software, in the machine
    - In the 1980's movies ("Blade Runner", "Wargames"), it's not the software's fault. The human factor is in question (unthinkable in the late 60's)
    - In 2013, the movie "Her" is about a man who falls in love with his machine. (unthinkable in the 80's)
- Special Effects: From stop motion and perspective tricks to special effects and computer animation
- Change is stunts: From stunts being performed by stuntmen and stuntwomen to them being done by the actors in front of greenscreens
