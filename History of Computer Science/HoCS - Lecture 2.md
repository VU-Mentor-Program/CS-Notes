# Cold War Science
> [!quote] Britain was the only country other than the United States not so devastated by the war that it could establish a serious computer research program
> ~ Campbell-Kelly

- After [[World War II|WW II]] need for scientific calculations exploded, with big players such as NASA or atomic power
- In continental Europe, this happened as well:
	- Even though countries were devastated after the war, countries were rebuilding ([[Marschallplan]])
	- Building a computer was not that expensive relatively
	- There was a mix of fatalism and optimism
- The [[Manhattan Project]] required many calculations to be done, empowering changes
- Code Breaking (Bletchly Park)
- Supplying troops
- Mathematisch Centrum (1946) was established in Amsterdam
	- There were several ties to the Moore school
- Cold war Europe was not following in every respect
	- Europe wanted to compete with the flow of American products and technology flowing into Europe
	- A need was felt to have their own products, technologies, ideas, associations and computers
	- Within every European country there were scientists trying to build machines. They did not want to be dependent on America
- Certain components were mass-produced during the war and were now cheap to buy and available
- Can man build a superman? Harvards Mark III soon to be delivered to the Navy
# (Dutch) Dinosaurs
## Why?
- Aeronautics
- Land reclamation projects: H.A. Lorentz and C. Lely needed large calculations for the Zuiderzee land reclamations. They designed the
    calculations and had human computers perform them
- Process control: Johan van Veen designed analog machines with the purpose of solving hydrology problems
- Deltar was a machine used to perform calculations for the Zeeland land reclamations
	- It could simulate tides and riverine environments

> Nobody doubts the innocence of automatic calculators, but, like any piece of technology, it is constructed for a specific purposek and once in existence it can be used for good and for evil. You can't wish them away. Although these machines were devised for destruction, it i snow our duty to put them to good use. They might lead to the loss of labour, with all the horrible social consequences that go with that. But they might also help to prevent disaster in the future.

## Amsterdam
- Aad van Wijngarden went to England to see what progress was being done there and came back to Amsterdam with ideas
	- He assembled parts and people and started building a computer
	- June 21, 1952 he presented the ARRA to the minister of sciences, with a program that could generate a random number
	- The machine worked during the presentation, but never afterwards
- The ARRA II was assembled from transistors instead of relays and vacuum tubes. It was quite successful and worked for a while
- The ARMAC came from the ARRA in 1956
- The Electrologica X1 was built on the ARRA II design in 1956 and was a spin-off of the mathematical centrum
## Delft
- Willem van der Poel was from the school of fiber optics and was interested in having a machine that could calculate compelx constellations of optical lenses
- In 1950 he constructed the ARCO (Automatic Relais Calculator for Optical problems). It was nicknamed Testudo (turtle) because it was so incredibly slow
	- programs were hard-wired but interchangeable
- Delft had connections with the dutch telephone company PTT and they created the ZERO for them in 1951. The PTT wanted a machine that could replace the operator. They used it under the name of PTERA
- 1955 they designed the ZEBRA (Zeer Eenvoudig Binair Reken Apparaat) and it was produced by STANTEC in the UK, because in the Netherlands, Philips was not interested
## Eindhoven
- Philips was building machines
- 1952-1956 the PETER was built. Wim Nijenhuis was the chief engineer and wanted a machine that could test electronics and perform calculations with the result. They did not mass produce these machines, because they had an agreement with IBM, whereby IBM would produce computers and buy Philips parts for them
- Philips built PASCAL (Philips Akelig Snelle Calculator) and STEVIN (Snel Tel- En Vermeningvuildigings Instrument) that were used within the Philips laboratories
## Observations
- These machines were built in order to function
- They were useful for very specific jobs or for applications where there was absolutely no room for human errors
- The names and the machines proved the European necessity to establish something in electronic computing. Machines became an element of national pride
# 1984 and the public
- In the book "*1984*", George Orwell described a world that would go berserk on systems thinking (mathematics, science, etc). Technology could cause a shift in power structures. It portrayed totalitarianism through surveillance technology.

> Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past.
> ~1984

- Computers were misunderstood and only gave output to the corresponding input (the human is still in control over what comes out)
  -> Everyone should learn how to program

- All major projects had to be sold. Documentaries were made about atomic power, for example ("A is for Atom" made by General Electric). A Disney documentary about space travel featured Werner von Braun with one of his space station models
- In "The Adventures of Tintin", when he asks a professor how he knows that his calculations are correct for the trajectory of a space rocket, a stack of papers is thrown at him. Calculations were done on paper
- Historically the rise of computing technology as part of modernity can be pinpointed to the *50s*
- After 1955, computers start emerging in popular culture:
	- In "Desk set (1957)", an office is invaded by machines that threaten to make the human workers obsolete and out of a job
- Isaac Asimov (1920-1992)
	- I, Robot (1950)
	- Foundation (1951)
	- The last question (1956)
