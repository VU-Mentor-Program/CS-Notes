# Agendas
- People wanted to achieve different things: Selling machines, academic discipline, thinking machines
	- There were different agendas in different parts of the world (Us worked on atomic weapons while dutch scientists worked on waterworks)
- 5 main agendas within the academic world:
	1. Cybernetics (Norbert Winer, Claude Shannon)
	2. Logic (Turing, Church)
	3. Sharing information (people from CERN or people in the field of astronomy)
	4. Ordering, sorting, processing (administration business, economics, business analytics, business-oriented research in general)
	5. Calculations
- Real time computing was an agenda
# Real time Computing
- Came to Europe not through the military or airline reservations but through banks: Barclay's cash dispensers in 1967
- Banks were the first to adapt to real time machines
	- with the card, people wanted to know at any point whether there was money in an account
- "Cashless society" became an ideal
- Barclays was presenting itself as a modern bank
	- Batch jobs running at their computer center
- Barclays need a central computer node that would store, manage and distribute information about bank accounts
- The company of the future "Bringing business automation to far-sighted companies"
- Barclays and Burrough partnership
- Burrough had problems supplying B8500 and installed two B6500s
- Problem with computer center location 
- Barclays had to switch from being real-time to being on-time
## UPC (Universal Product Code, 1973)
- Was a necessity for larger companies, for smaller companies an extra burden when entering the market
- proved growing trust in machines
- European Article Number Code in Europe -> IPC (International Product Code)
	- political choice and brought the European countries closer together, creating a common market
	- stand against the dominance of American technology
# Programming languages: ALGOL, BASIC
- programming on tape/plugboard would be very hard
- feedback was received only through audio
- Programs were things that you **prepared** and **assembled**
- Project Whirlwind made people think of more efficient solutions ("autocoding")
	- FORTRAN (1957)
	- COBOL (1959)
- BASIC (1965) popular in US colleges and later among computer amateurs
- **Only** ALGOL 60 used in Europe
	- considered elegant and satisfied a sense of clarity and order
	- universal (ideal both for machines and as a language)
- From US point of view considered academic, not flexible (better in theory than in practice) and difficult to learn

> [!danger] Problems
> - Making existing programs run on a new machine
> - Ease of programming

- People dreamed of ALGOL being a universal language
- Beginning 60s software alone did not suffice to uphold a business: a range of computer services
	- Maintenance
	- Machine building / tuning
	- Batch processing
- Software wasn't defined concretely
	- code produced by programmers was considered "code" or "program"
- IBM "unbundled" software from hardware sales -> software was no longer free
- Separating software and hardware led to the rise of a software-industry in Europe
# The software crisis
- Programs were growing in length and the number of people working on it was always increasing
- Code was rarely fool-proof, a crisis was proclaimed. According to Campbell-Kelly, this was done because it helped American academics towards their goal of building out IT professionalism
- In Europe, a similar "crisis" occurred
    - When there was a problem, there was usually at least a company offering a solution
    - In the academic world, there were problems with getting computer science incorporated within universities. These new fields were part of either an engineering program, a mathematical program or a program within the social sciences. Academics were eager to get rid of that financing ballast, which is easier in a "crisis"
    - While in the US, university programs can be created at will, given that there are people who want it and funds to run it, in Europe they were government funded, so the government had to approve something new. Therefore, the need for these new computer scientists had to be explained, which was not evident in the 60s. Computer scientists were there, but they were engineers, mathematicians or social scientists. The field of computer science did not exist.
- Software engineering appeared as a way of solving a crisis:
	- implied that software was approachable -> could convince government to pay
- In Garmisch-Partenkirchen (1968) multiple associations (GAMM, universities, IFIP, ACM) called for a crisis. Solutions:
	- ~~Universal programming language?~~
	- Structured programming
	- Project management
- Agenda was set by academics: software engineering primarily theoretical
- Programmer became a profession and informatics became a science
- - Software engineering meant structured programming (preferred in Europe) and project management (preferred in America)
- Using formal methods, structured programming proved program correctness
