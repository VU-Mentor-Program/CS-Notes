# Machines and Technology
- Before the 19th century, machines were used for their novelty / entertainment value ○ Some machines were just trickery
- In the early 19th century, the steam engine was invented  
    ○ This proved that machines could serve a sensible purpose
1. **Historical mistake**: Not knowing your sources (A.M. Turing's A-machine)
   Pascal calculator <-> Leibniz calculator
2. **Historical mistake**: Anachronism
2. **Historical mistake**: Defining your subject
# Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
"*On the economy of machinery and manufactures*"
- Mathematician who was interested in the economy of businesses and how to make businesses more efficient
	- He was especially interested in using machines to achieve this
- Invented the [[Difference Engine]] and the [[Analytical Engine]]
- He wrote "*On the economy of machinery and manufactures*"
	- About businesses he had visited and how to make them more efficient by removing bottlenecks (often by using machines)
- Cam up with a non-mechanical solution too: **The clearing house**
	- A place where the bankers of London would meet and exchange checks
	- Babbage came up with the idea of replacing the massive clearing house on Lombard Street by having each bank open an account with the bank of England
	- This transformed the problem into an accounting task
	- This is considered one of his greatest achievements
	- It took banks decades to adopt this => Even good ideas sometimes take time to implement
# Frederik Taylor (1856-1915)
"*Shop management*" (1903)
"*The principles of Scientific management*" (1911)
- Designed principles that allowed manufacturers to identify and fix bottlenecks themselves
- Proposed more advanced labour division than Babbage had imagined
- Inspired Henry Ford, who invented the conveyor belt production line for cars
# Henri Fayol (1841-1925)
- After learning of Frederik Taylor's work, he introduced it into french mines
- Looking deeper into the matter, he realised that french bureaucracy could benefit form the same process
- His efficiency optimisations are focused on the **administration** part of the business, while his predecessors focused more on the **production** side
# Trust in numbers
- US census (since 1790): Predicting tax income, etc.
- Statistics are very valuable (Florence Nightingale) and people put more trust into machines
- The 1890 US census trust in Hollerith machines: Helped with the counting and creating tables
- European continent was politically more "leftish" than US/UK
	- US eagerly adopted *cash registers* before Europe did (more skeptic)
	- Companies were adjusted and didn't want to make as drastic measures as in the US
- Industrialists and governments believed that machines could make life easier
- Automation was most desired in administration, process control and science
	- US focused more on the administration side
	- Europe focused more on process control and science
# Three traditions
## Administration
- The office in the late 19th century meant a lot of clerks writing things and copying things by hand
- In the early 20th century, this was replaced by typewriters
	- They could use carbon paper to have several copies typed at once
- Punched card machines were introduced for sorting, tabulating, pay-checks
- Calculators, typewriters, sorting machines, counting machines, printers etc... were being introduced
- Using these machines, business administrators and owners could use Henri Fayol's and Frederik Taylor's principles in order to fix their businesses
- Not all businesses managed to successfully implement machines
- Not all of this was high-tech. High efficiency could be reached with filing cabinets too
	- Everything was following a business outline
## Process control
- There were processes that had to preferably be controlled from a distance (steel production, oil extraction and refining)
- This is a different kind of automation. Machines were using valves, sensors to take decisions themselves
	- Machines were begin supervised, not operated
## Science and Engineering
- Computers (PEOPLE!) were active in:
	1. Weather predictions
	2. Hydromechanical calculations
	3. Aeronautics
	4. Econometrics
	5. Telephone cables
- Douglas Hartree (1897-1958): "*Numerical Analysis*", Differential Analyser
	- These were analogue machines that were able to perform one type of calculation
- Most calculations were done on worksheets
## The three traditions
- All three used outlines
- The administration business had the most money, so it is not surprising that that is where the first computer came from
