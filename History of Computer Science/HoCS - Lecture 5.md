# Dream 1: Into the valley
- There were many hopes and dreams about what future computers could achieve (Ted Nelson *Computer Lib*, 1974)
- There were attempts of a Silicon Valley in Europe
	- High tech companies and universities were interested in time-sharing within them
	- There was not much interest from youth culture, which was crucial for the development of Silicon Valley
- Unlike the US, the hippies in Europe did not blend with the computer enthusiasts, so it did not cause the huge enthusiasm that occurred in Silicon Valley
- Amateur Computer club (ACC)
	- associated with amateur computer enthusiasts
	- only interested in their immediate surroundings (their own club), not changing the world
	- people wanted to join together and learn from each other
- Homebrew Computer Club (1975) - people got together and wanted to show and discuss what they could do with the machine and how it could be useful to the rest of the world. 
- Software would be swapped over mail in the form of tapes
## Internet
- **Common misconception 1**: Before the internet, getting information was hard
- **Common misconception 2**: The internet made knowledge accessible to everyone
## Education
- Logic makes things more simple (doesn't mean easier to learn)
- The concept of "Programmed Instruction" was also put into textbooks. This is an example of computing influencing education
# Dream 2: Systems thinking
- George Orwell, *1984*
- Systems are everywhere, and the idea that a system is the perfect way to describe a process, is followed by: Systems as the perfect mould for similar processes
