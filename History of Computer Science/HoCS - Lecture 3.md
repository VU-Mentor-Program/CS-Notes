# Computing Sounds
- Maurice Wilkes (Cambridge, 1949) was proud of the EDSAC
- To see if the computer or the program was working, you could listen to the different components (vacuum tubes)
	- No screens to see progress
- Christopher Strachey could make it hum music like an instrument
- Later machines with transistors had speakers
	- UNIVAC had a "Stall Speaker" button -> speaker on by default
	- Usually the case for most early computers
- Sounds were used for various reasons:
	1. Announcing the program was terminated
	2. Auditive monitoring (it works)
	3. Specific navigation within a program
	4. Part of the instruction (Knowing where in the program the computer currently is)
# Computing and use of metaphors
- To program meant to prepare a program
- Programming started being used as a verb in 1948
- Metaphors means appropriating a machine. Taking a machine and making it do something, sometimes that it's not meant to do, just to see if it works
- Programming terms in early 1950s: Plugging, pseudo coding, assembling, auto-coding (rewiring cables)
- 1960: Programming language were **translated** by the computer into wiring
  -> **Reassuring names for new things**
- Memory: delay line stored a bit for a very short time
- Bolter (1984) "*Defining technology*": Once technology become **ubiquitous**, those words are used to describe everyday life.
  (ex. Education is "programming a child", taking a holiday is like "wiping your hard-drive")
# IBM and (European) dwarves
- Odhner (1873) - Russia
	- Odhner Arithmometer sold all over Europe, and stoped production during Russian revolution in beginning 20th century
- Atvidaberg Industrie (1920)  Sweden
	- Produced calculating machines
	- Bankrupt in 1970 and sold to Electrolux
	- Failed to innovate after WW2
- Zuse KG - Germany
	- Produced partly mechanical computing machines
	- Sold in 1967 to Siemens AG
- Ferranti - Britain
	- Commercialised the Manchester Baby
- Bull - France
	- 1930 produced office machinery
	- Gamma 3 and Gamma 60 electronic computers for administration and serving in automatic business
- Electrologica - Netherlands
	- commercial production of the ARMAC
	- successful with science field, but not so much with administration
	- 1966 bought by Philips
- Regnecentralen (1955) - Denmark
	- clients encouraged to buy devices to increase value of stock
	- provided customer adapted software
- International Computers Limited (1968) - Britain
	- Merged from multiple smaller companies (Ferranti, Elliot, Regnecentralen)
	- Sold IBM compatible systems
	- bought by Fujitsu in 2002
- Eastern Europe
	- Antonin Svoboda from Czechoslovakia returned to Prague after the war and set out to form a laboratory for information processing
	- Antonin and Vaclav Hruska started project on building machine
		- project was a state-organized company that would build machines for government purposes
		- EPOS released in 1959
	- Czechsolovakia joined COMECON
	- 1968 United systems of Electronic Computers produced IBM clones for all COMECON countries
## Summary
> [!question] Too late taking part in new developments?
> - Until 1980s, European companies were playing a role
> - They all started about the time the UNIVAC started
> - Companies built products for scientific use, not for *administration* which was more popular
>   -> had to compete with IBM

- large companies like Philips and Siemens, who would have had the resources to compete with IBM, had agreements with IBM to not compete
- When governments had to retreat their funding after 1965, few companies had the resources to stay afloat
- -  1960: 60% of machines in europe were IBM. 90% of machines in europe were not european
- -  IBM's sales strategy was superior
