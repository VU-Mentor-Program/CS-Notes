(Links:: [[History of CS]])
- Computers were originally used by scientist and the military
  -> They were built for sheer processing power
- **Late 19th century**: Businesses (large and small) needed to process more and more data 
  -> the desk calculator industry skyrocketed
- **First half of the 20th century**: Punched-card systems gained worldwide popularity (originally developed to aid with the US census)
	- These were also the origins of [[IBM]]
- Because of military spending during [[World War II]], the first **electronic, stored-program computers** were built (but none were actually ready in time for the war)
- After the war, computer manufacturers found a market in Governments, insurance agencies, businesses, etc.
- **1945: [[John von Neumann]]** set the basic specifications for the computer in place in a report
	- These are still largely followed today
