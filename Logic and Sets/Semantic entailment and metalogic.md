(Links:: [[Logic and Sets]])
## Logical reasoning versus a truth table
**Logical reasoning**
- works by excluding possibilities
- makes the logical chain of arguments explicit
- requires intuition and logical argumentation

A **truth table**
- is exhaustive and mechanical
- but also laborious and error-prone
- and buries intuition under a pile of `T`'s and `F`'s
