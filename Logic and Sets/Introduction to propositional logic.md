> [!summary]+ Subset
> $A \subseteq B$ means all elements of A are elements of B
> $A \nsubseteq B$ means at least one element of A is not in B

> [!summary]+ equality
> $A = B$ <=> $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$

> [!summary]+ Definition of empty set
> $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$ is the (unique) set that has no elements

> [!summary]+ Union and intersection
> $A \cup B := {s \in (: x \in A\; and\; x \in B})$
