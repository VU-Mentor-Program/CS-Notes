There is a midterm exam and a final exam. The midterm exam covers the material of the first three weeks of the course, and the final exam focuses on the material that is treated in the lectures from week four onward. Your grade is computed as 0.4M+0.6F, where M is the grade for the midterm, and F the grade for the final exam. For both the midterm and the final exam, at least a 5.0 must be achieved. And the overall grade must be at least 5.5. Only final exam scripts submitted by students who are eligible to take this exam will be graded.

If your overall grade is insufficient (or you miss out on the midterm or final exam), you can take part in the resit exam, which covers all material of the course. In particular, **it is not possible to resit only the midterm or only the final exam**. At least a 5.5 must be achieved for the resit exam to pass the course.
