An equivalence relation in A is a relation of type $A\times A$ that is reflexive , transitive and symmetric:
- the **equivalence class** of an element $a\in A$ is the set $[a]:=\{x\in A:x\equiv a\}$
	- all elements of an equivalence class relate to each other
	- elements of different equivalence classes are unrelated
- The quivalence classes together form a partition of the set A
  Example: $A:=\{0,1\}^3$
  $x\equiv y$ <-> x and y contain same number of 0's
  $\{[a]:a\in A\}=\{[000],[001],[011],[111]\}$ is a partition of A
- A **complete system or representatives** for $\equiv$ in A is a set $S\subseteq A$ that contains precisely one element from each equivalence class
  Example: Congruence modulo 3 in $\Bbb N$
  $\{[n]:n\in \Bbb N\}=\{[0],[1],[2]\}$
  $S=\{0,1,2\}$
- To **prove** a relation ias an equivalence relation, you must prove reflexivity, transitivit and symmetry
