### Course Objective
After completing this course, the student can:
1. express logical statements in propositional and predicate logic
(Knowledge and understanding) (Applying knowledge and understanding)
2. reason about the meaning of such formulas through truth tables and
models (Applying knowledge and understanding) (Making judgements)
3. argue formally whether one formula implies another one, or that they
are equivalent (Applying knowledge and understanding) (Making
judgements)
4. reduce a propositional formula to disjunctive or conjunctive normal
form (Knowledge and understanding) (Applying knowledge and
understanding)
5. express propositional formulas in logic circuits and OBDDs (Knowledge
and understanding) (Applying knowledge and understanding)

Furthermore, the student is able to:
6. reason about set constructions through Venn diagrams and the algebra
of sets (Applying knowledge and understanding) (Making judgements)
7. construct and interpret formal, graphic, and matrix representations
of sets, relations and functions (Knowledge and understanding) (Applying
knowledge and understanding) (Making judgements)
8. determine and argue whether (Knowledge and understanding) (Applying
knowledge and understanding) (Making judgements):
a. a relation is reflexive, transitive, symmetric or antisymmetric.
b. a relation is an ordering relation, equivalence relation, or a
function
c. a function is injective or surjective
9. construct and interpret compositions of relations (or functions) and
their inverses (Knowledge and understanding) (Applying knowledge and
understanding) (Making judgements)
10. construct a proof by mathematical induction (Knowledge and
understanding) (Applying knowledge and understanding)
### Course Content
The sets part of the course starts by introducing the concepts of sets,
Venn diagrams, product sets and relations. The student then learns the
main characteristics and properties of three particular types of
relation: ordering relations, equivalence relations and functions. The
sets part concludes with a study of the principle of mathematical
induction.

The logic part focuses in the first place on propositional logic: truth
tables, boolean operators, functional completeness, logical puzzles,
SAT-solving, logic circuits and OBDDs. In addition the student will
learn the meaning and use formulas of predicate logic, to express
mathematical properties and sentences from natural language.
