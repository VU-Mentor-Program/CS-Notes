- Your solutions for the first 4 labs will be graded with a grade, called **LAB.** $$LAB = (LAB_1 \times 0.1+ LAB_{2}\times0.3 + LAB_3\times0.3+LAB_4\times0.3)$$
- For the project you will get a grade, called **PROJ**, calculated as follows: $$PROJ = (0.5*document) + (0.3*code) + (0.2*presentation)$$
- For the whole practical you will get a grade **PRAC,** calculated as follows: $$PRAC = (0.6*PROJ) + (0.4*LAB)$$
- Your final grade is calculated on a scale from 1 to 10, as follows: $$Final grade = (0.5*PRAC) + (0.5*EXAM)$$
  where **EXAM** is the written exam grade (from 1 to 10).

**Both components EXAM and PRAC are compulsory and need to be >=5.5 in order to pass the course. There is no resit for the  PRAC.**
