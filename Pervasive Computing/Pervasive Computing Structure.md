All you need to know about the organization of the course can be found in the course guide. However, here we summarize the most important rules.

- **Attendance to practical sessions is compulsory**. If it happens that you are not able to attend a practical session, you need to inform your TA as soon as possible by mentioning a valid reason. You will have to join the practical session in Zoom to help your team.
- **Active participation is required from all group members.** If everything goes fine, all the group members will get the same PRAC grade. Please report cooperation problems to your TA as soon as possible. If problems will be reported, the grades might vary.
- **Late deliveries without a valid reason will be penalized.**
- **Plagiarism is defined as presenting someone elseâ€™s work, in whole or in part, as your own.** All submissions will be tested for plagiarism and all students involved in fraud will receive a zero mark and will face disciplinary action.
