# Introduction
- 98% of Microprocessors go into:
	- Mobile phones
	- Cards
	- Household appliances
	- Social robots
	- Entertainment
	- Health
	- Transportation
- Computing is **embedded in everyday objects**
- An **embedded system** is a computer whose end function is **not** to be a computer
# Ubiquitous computing
> [!quote] Mark Weiser
> "Each person is continually interacting with **hundreds** of ... **interconnected** computers" that "weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are **indistinguishable** from it."
> 
> "Where virtual reality puts people inside a computer-generated world, ubiquitous computing forces the computer *to live out here in the world with people*."

- Weiser proposed a range of device sizes:
	- **Smart Tabs:** Wearable centimeter-sized devices to track goods
	- **Smart Pads:** Hand-held decimetre-sized devices for personalised communication
	- **Smart Boards:** Meter sized displays and surfaces for collaboration
- Computing waves
	- Mainframe: Multiple users on one system
	- Personal computing: One user on one system
	- Ubicomp: One user, multiple devices
- **Ubicomp** is possible because...
	- **Miniaturization**
		- **Moore's Law:** Number of transistors that can be packed inexpensively on a chip doubles approximately every two years
	- Communication and networking
	- Artificial intelligence
	- Sensing technology
	- Materials science (smart materials, better batteries, biofuels)
	- Multimodal human computer interaction
- **M**icro-**E**lectro **M**echanical **S**ystems
	- The MEMS technique results in close integration of the mechanical mechanism with the necessary electronic circuit on a single silicon chip

# Smart Systems
- Key components of robots
	- **Sensors**: used to gain context information
	- **Actuators**: used to affect the environment
	- **Controllers or Agents** (hardware and software): use sensor's data to extract context, decide actions and then control the actuators
- ![[Smart Systems.png|500]]
- Main properties for a smart system
	- Autonomous
	- Distributed
	- iHCI
	- Context-aware
	- Intelligent
- Problems
	- Privacy
	- Emotional attachment
	- Liability
	- Legal rights
	- Energy
	- Scale
	- Waste

# Conclusion
- Ubiquitous computing is a post-desktop model of human-computer interaction in which information processing is integrated into everyday objects and activities
- Pervasive computing is building interactive systems with sensors, actuators and controllers
- The highest ideal is to make a computer so embedded and so natural, that we use it without even thinking about it
- This cannot be achieved by only solving the technical problems. We also have to think about the people using these systems. A **multidisciplinary** approach is needed
