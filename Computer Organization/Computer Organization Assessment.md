1.  (Mandatory) basic lab assignments.
2.  (Mandatory) final exam, on-campus, multiple choice.
3.  (Optional) mid-term exam, on-campus, multiple choice. The results of the mid-term exam count only if the final exam is also taken by the student, and only if it increases the final grade of the student.
4.  (Optional) in-class exercises, including quizzes during select lectures and tutorials.
5.  (Optional) self-study exercises, including solving exercises from the course book and previous exams.
6.  (Optional) bonus lab assignments.

All partial results (including the lab, and the mid-term and final exams) are only valid during one academic year. The end grade is the total number of points accumulated across all assessment possibilities scored divided by 1000. It is possible to score a perfect 10 as final grade.
