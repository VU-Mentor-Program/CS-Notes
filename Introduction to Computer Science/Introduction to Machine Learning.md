# Introduction to ML
Machine learning is the area of computer science that relates to the capability of computers to **learn from data**.
Three types of machine learning tasks
- **Supervised learning** is the task of inferring a classification or regression from labeled training data.
- **Unsupervised learning** is the task used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.
- **Reinforcement learning (RL)** is the task concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize cumulative (delayed) rewards.
## Deep Learning
- Update/transform parameters of network with errors of previous tests.
- Input activates other neurons that are triggered on different parameters.
- All the parameters of a neural network are trained in order to **minimize a cost function**.
