# What AI errors could tell you about bias and inclusivity?
## About the talk:
AI can have critical impacts on people or society, for instance by creating bias and discrimination. These impacts are difficult to assess and communicate to practitioners or end-users, and this gap worsens the ethical issues. This talk will discuss the means to inform AI practitioners and end-users about discrimination and diversity issues through the lens of a seemingly simple task: measuring AI errors.  We will highlight key challenges with collecting reliable test data, and assessing the test data as well as the test results. We will draw inspiration from applications that require strict uncertainty assessments, e.g., in health, or ecology, and argue that designing transparent, fair and inclusive AI encompasses the design of both AI systems and the human ecosystems in which they take part.

## About the speaker:
Emma Beauxis-Aussalet is an Assistant Professor of Ethical Computing at VU Amsterdam. She received her PhD from Utrecht University in 2019, her Master in Computer Science from Centrale Paris in 2008, and her Master in Communication and Digital Media from IESA Paris in 2007 (cum laude). Before becoming a researcher, she had multi-disciplinary experience in the industry as a designer, R&D engineer, data specialist, and project leader. Her understanding of the interplay between design, research, and engineering fuels her research on the practical means to harness the multi-faceted impacts of AI on society.
