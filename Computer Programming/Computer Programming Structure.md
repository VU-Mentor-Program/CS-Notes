### Programming Labs
At the end, the whole programming lab will result in a single grade, that will be combined with your exam grade and your bonus points. (see elsewhere) Here, we explain how your grade for the programming lab will be computed.
### Submission
First you develop your program in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or your favorite editor. Then, you submit it via Canvas to CodeGrade. In CodeGrade, tests will run automatically that check whether your program does what it is supposed to do. If these tests indicate problems with your program, you can improve it and resubmit. (But see also below under Resubmission policy.)
### Automated plagiarism checking
Submitted programs will be checked automatically by CodeGrade for structural similarity among each other, and also w.r.t. to the submissions to similar assignments from the previous years. Once CodeGrade reports high similarity scores among multiple submissions, your friendly teacher will study the similar programs and take action as necessary. This may include requesting further explanation from the students as well as forwarding the case to the examination board of the Faculty of Science. (see also the separate page on Ethical behaviour and fraud)
