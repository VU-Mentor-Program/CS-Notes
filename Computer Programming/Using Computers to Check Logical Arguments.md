# Using Computers to Check Logical Arguments
# Background of logic
## The simplest logic: propositional logic
- Propositional logic consists of **atomic propositions** like "the sky is blue"
- Logical operator can be used to combine atomic propositions ($\land, \lor, \lnot, \to$)
## The limits of propositional logic
How to express the following reasoning in propositional logic?
All humans are mortal
Julie is human
Therefore Julie is mortal

There's no good way!
This is where first-order logic comes into play.
## A stronger logic: first-order logic
First-order logic consists of **predicates** like "is human" and "is mortal" and of terms like "Julie"
- Predicates can be applied to terms to form propositions
- Logical operators can be used to combine atomic proposition
