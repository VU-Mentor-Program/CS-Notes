**The gist (a.k.a. TL;DR)**
Basically, your lab grade L will be determined by the weighted average of the six homework assignments. This average goes up to 8.5 (out of 10). If you wish a higher grade, you must also do the challenge assignments. Next, it is mandatory to do both the warm-up and review assignments. For each of these, if you do not submit it in time, your lab grade will be lowered by 0.5 (or by 0.1 if you are no more than one week late).

**The details**
Admittedly, this is a bit complicated, as we have to stick with what Canvas can do to add up results...

Overall, your lab grade $L$ will be computed as:  **$L = -6 + 3 * W + 3 * R + 8.5 * H + 1.5 * C$**

$L$ will be cut off in (the unlikely) case of being lower than 0 or higher than 10.

**Warm-up assignments (W)**
Each of the six modules has a warm-up assignment. You solve the assignment and get it accepted by your TA during one of the lab sessions. Part of getting it accepted is that you explain your program to the TA. Acceptance is pass or fail. The TA may request that you improve your program before it can get accepted. For warm-up assignments, students may decide to work together in pairs within the same lab group. Both students must be able to explain their program to the TA. This is the only exception to the rule that students must submit exclusively their own solutions.

The grade for a warm-up assignment is:

accepted no later than the deadline: 10pts
accepted no later than one week after the deadline: 8pts
otherwise: 0pts
W will be the percentage of points achieved with the six warm-up assignments.

**Review assignments (R)**
Each of the six modules also has a code review assignment. In weeks 2-6, you review three submissions to the homework assignment from the week before. (you do this in CodeGrade) To get your TA to accept your review, you show it to him/her during a lab session. Acceptance is pass or fail.  In week 1, you have a Canvas assignment for reviewing three programs we provide. Here, you submit a short (really!) report as a PDF to Canvas. Review assignments are strictly individual. The grade for a review assignment is:

accepted no later than the deadline: 10pts
accepted no later than one week after the deadline: 8pts
otherwise: 0pts
R will be the percentage of points achieved with the six review assignments.

**Homework assignments (H)**
Each of the six modules has a homework assignment. Homeworks are strictly for individual solutions! You submit your homework in CodeGrade. The grading of the assignments is done by a randomly assigned TA. The rubrics for each assignment, provided in CodeGrade, will show the focus of each assignment. Furthermore, the first criterion in the rubrics is mandatory: if your program does not do what is required in the assignment text, you can not get a pass (or grade â‰¥ 5.5) for the assignment in question. For each homework assignment, you can get at most a grade of 8.5. For homework assignments, you must submit your program before the deadline. Late submissions will be accepted, however, 1 point is deducted for every day the assignment is handed in late. Only your newest submission will be graded.

The homework grade H is computed as the percentage of points achieved with the six homework assignments using the following weights:

| Homework | Weight | Max. Points |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1        | 1      | 10          |
| 2        | 1      | 10          |
| 3        | 1      | 10          |
| 4        | 2      | 20          |
| 5        | 2.5    | 25          |
| 6        | 2.5    | 25          |

**Challenge assignments (C)**
If you are in for a challenge, and you wish for a lab grade L higher than 8.5, you can participate in the weekly "90 minutes challenge". Challenges will be in weeks 2 to 6 only. Challenge assignments are strictly individual. You can take part in a challenge if your TA has accepted both your warm-up and review assignment for the running week. How do you take part in a challenge assignment?

have warm-up and review assignment done for the week
request from your TA that you are going to do the weekly challenge during the next lab session. (preferably beforehand, so you won't loose time) 
at the beginning of the lab session, receive the assignment description (a PDF file)
dive into your challenge during the lab session
submit into CodeGrade (and run the tests as usual)
at the end, let your TA approve your solution
A challenge acceptance is pass or fail. Your code does not have to be super clean and beautiful, it should just be a reasonable solution to the problem. The grade for a challenge assignment is:

acceptable submission within 90 minutes: 10pts
acceptable submission within 24 hours: 8pts
otherwise: 0pts
C will be the percentage of points achieved with the five challenge assignments.
