# Sorts of Bugs
**Troubleshooting** is a systematic process for finding and fixing a problem's cause in a system.
1. Create a hypothesis. A **hypothesis** states a possible cause of a problem.
2. Run a test. A **test** is a procedure whose result validates or invalidates a hypothesis
Those steps are repeated until a test's result validates a hypothesis.
The troubleshooting process is to hypothesize the cause, and run a test to validate or invalidate the hypotheses. If validated, the cause has been found. If invalidated, repeat.
# Logic of troubleshooting
**Hypotheses**
A Hypothesis should be a statement of a possible cause, stated so as to be either true or false.

**Testing a hypothesis**
A test is a procedure typically with two possible results that either validate or invalidate a hypothesis.
## Asymmetric tests
- Symmetric test: A result of Yes validates, and a No invalidates
  Ex: Lamp wire unplugged -> observe the wire plugged
- Asymmetric test: A result of Yes validates, but a No does not invalidate (or vice versa)
  Ex: Bulb broken -> shake the buld and listen for rattling
  => Not hearing rattling does **NOT** invalidate!
