**Defining an algorithm**
The complex definition of an algorithm involves several properties, such as:
- collection of steps: every algorithm is composed of individual steps
- definite: every step must be clearly defined
- sequential. every step must be performed in the specified order
# General
In the information age, many people belive **computational thinking**, or creating a sequence of instructions to solve a problem, will become increasingly important for work and everyday life. A sequence of instructions that solves a problem is called an **algorithm**
# Strategies for Problem-solving
- Define the problem
	- First find what you are trying to achive in order to find what exactly is problematic 
- Decompose the task
	- break down a (complex) task into several smaller and manageable bits to deal with

- Using a brute force strategy on a problem will always yieled the correct solution
# Pseudocode
When you are dealing with a problem, you can write u pan **algorithm** to solve it.
