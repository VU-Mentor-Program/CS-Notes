## Assignments
We have 6 modules in total, spread over 7 weeks. Due to various scheduling issues, we will distribute the topics as follows:

We have two types of assignments. The working group assignments are not graded, the homework assignments are.

During the working group meetings, the working group assignments are discussed. This should help you complete the homework assignment for the same week. The deadline for the homework is Sunday night of the week. In the working group that follows, the homework solutions will be briefly discussed. (No homework discussion is possible for module 6.)

**We expect you to prepare for the working group assignments before attending the working group meeting.**

**Homework is to be done by each student individually. Group work (multiple students submitting a joint solution) is not allowed. It should go without saying that you must not submit any solutions that are not your own. The latter is considered plagiarism and will be treated as such.**

Each homework assignment will be graded by the following simple scheme:

Insufficient, handed in late or not at all: 0 points
Sufficient: 6 points
pretty good: 8 points
Great: 10 points
Your homework grade is the average of all homework grades.
