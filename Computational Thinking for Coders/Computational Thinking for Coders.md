# [Computational Thinking for Coders](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/64375)
This course revolves around self-study with the interactive course e-book, in combination with class sessions for deepening understanding (1 time per week), and working groups (1 time per week). We have 6 class sessions in weeks 1-6, and 6 working groups in weeks 2-7.

Weekly graded homework assignments measure the learning progress during the course. At the end, a written (computer-based) exam tests the overall achievement. The average grade of the homework assignments, and the exam grade both contribute 50% each to the final grade, and both parts must be passed (a grade of 5.5 or higher) in order to pass the course. There will be a resit exam, but there is no resit opportunity for the homework assignments. Students can raise their overall grade by up to 1 bonus point by timely completion of the exercises in the interactive e-book (chapters labeled "CT").
