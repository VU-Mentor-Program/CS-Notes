Welcome to Object-Oriented and Functional Programming (OOFP)!

The goal of this course is to obtain familiarity and experience with more advanced programming language concepts, such as sub typing and pattern matching, in addition to furthering your programming skills.  
After taking this course, you will be able to:  
- Understand and apply concepts from object-oriented programming such as sub typing and inheritance.  
- Understand and apply concepts from functional programming such as pattern matching and higher-order functions.  
- Design and implement a moderately large program from scratch.  
- Produce clear, readable code.

After taking this course, it should be easier to pick up any programming language, because many of the employed concepts will be already familiar to you.
# Course Content
The lectures cover diverse concepts from the object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, and how they appear in various programming languages. Some of the concepts we’ll cover include: inheritance, subtyping, parametric polymorphism, side effects, higher-order functions, and pattern matching. The lectures also cover how to produce clear, readable code.

We will use the programming language **Scala** to explore these programming language concepts. We use Scala **2**, you cannot use Scala 3 as this will upset the automated tests.

There are four programming assignments, which will give you experience in designing and implementing relatively non-trivial programs. Moreover, the assignments intend to train you in producing clear, readable code. The assignments also aim to provide you with an opportunity to apply the programming concepts from the lectures.

There is no mandatory attendance in this course.

Since all the material is already available, you can work ahead as much as you want. The only things you cannot do ahead of time are the peer review assignment 2.2 (available from 18 September) and the exam.
# Lectures

The lectures cover diverse concepts from the object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, and how they appear in various programming languages.

Lectures are on 
- Mondays 11:00-12:45 in IN-0B60 
- Thursdays 11:00-12:45 in IN-0B60 

We also offer the videos that were recorded for the 2021 edition, which cover the same material. The lectures will also discuss exam-type questions, which are also discussed in the "on campus sessions" videos of 2021.
# Book

The book offers a different angle on the material and helps you deepen your understanding of the material. Each week lists the relevant chapters of the book. The book is more focussed on Scala than the lectures, which also cover other languages.

# Practical sessions

Practical sessions are available in weeks 36-42, from September 4th 2022 up to and including 19 October.

We have the following practical sessions each week:

- [Tuesday 11:00-12:45](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1URr-EL-IkYO51q_HxZUjFa_vXB99s1WaLKpqpM0qJ3E/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Links to an external site.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1URr-EL-IkYO51q_HxZUjFa_vXB99s1WaLKpqpM0qJ3E/edit?usp=sharing) (Only if you've signed up for Tuesday)
- [Wednesday 13:30-15:30](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rBKcEXYCEdOi54T8cki2ua3Dh9oA6DbAJjF93DSePmk/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Links to an external site.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rBKcEXYCEdOi54T8cki2ua3Dh9oA6DbAJjF93DSePmk/edit?usp=sharing) (Only if you've signed up for Wednesday)
- [Thursday 13:30-15:30](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q4InR5VFfvf7yUuHXsckUigsBi7NS15GMmrnKbLzk8A/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Links to an external site.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q4InR5VFfvf7yUuHXsckUigsBi7NS15GMmrnKbLzk8A/edit?usp=sharing) (For everyone)

Unfortunately, the TA capacity of the Tuesday session is about double that of the Wednesday session, so to ensure that sessions do not overflow you have to sign up for either the Tuesday or the Wednesday session ([in people-> Tue/Wed session](https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/71445/groups#tab-34547))

For each session, we use a live Google sheet that notes which rooms are in use, which TAs are where, and where there are seats available. Please consult this before going to a room. These can befound by clicking on the link for the session in the link above.

# Hand-in assignments 

This course has **individual** programming assignments. There are 6 mandatory programming assignments and 1 optional bonus programming assignment. All deadlines are at 23:59 of the deadline day. Note that the course has a deadline each week on Sunday,  + one extra deadline on Wednesday 21 September. While the deadlines are on Sunday, the idea is that you work on the assignments during the week. If you fail to make it, there is then still time during the weekend. _Note that there is no help available from TAs during the weekend!_

If you miss a deadline, you can still hand in the assignment later, but your grade is maximally a 5.5. This is called handing in an assignment _asynchronously_ as is described in more detail below.



| _Number_ | _Assignment name_      | _Deadline_             | _Weight_     |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Warm-up                | Sunday 10 September    | 1            |
| 2.1      | Snake no reverse       | Sunday 17 September    | Pass/Fail    |
| 2.2      | Snake peer review      | Wednesday 20 September | Pass/Fail    |
| 2.3      | Snake + reverse        | Sunday 24 September    | 2.25         |
| 3.1      | Tetris basics          | Sunday 1 October       | Pass/Fail    |
| 3.2      | Full Tetris            | Sunday 8 October       | 2.25         |
| 4.1      | IntREPL + MultiSet     | Sunday 15 October      | Pass/Fail    |
| 4.2      | MultiSetRepl + Sharing | Sunday 22 October      | 3.5          |
| B        | Bonus Assignment       | Sunday 30 October      | 2 (optional) |

You must get at least a 5.5 for Warm-up, Snake + reverse, Tetris, and REPLS each to pass the course.

If you do not pass 2.1 or do not pass 2.2, _your grade for 2.3 is capped at a 5.5_ it will be considered an asynchronous submission (see below what this means), even if you handed it in on time. The same holds for 3.2 and 4.2: they will only be graded >= 5.5 if you pass 3.1 or 4.2 respectively. 

Without the bonus assignment, your grade for the course can maximally be a 9.5. With the bonus assignment, your grade is maximally an 10.5. The grade for the course is 0.6 * assignments_grade + 0.4 * exam_grade. Note that you **must get at least a 5.5 for both** the exam and the assignments, otherwise your grade is an "NVD" (not fulfilled).

# Quizzes

Each week has a corresponding quiz, with a deadline the following Wednesday. These quizzes feature exam-type questions about the material of that week. These quizzes are intended to help you practice for the exam. You can take them multiple times and see the correct answers. There is no penalty for failing a quiz. Next to these 7 quizzes, there are some more exam-type practice quizzes if you go to quizzes in canvas.

# Handing in an assignment asynchronously

You can now hand in assignments later than the deadline, but your grade for that assignment will be a 5.5 maximally. I call this handing in an assignment _asynchronously._

When handing in an assignment asynchronously:

- You can hand in your assignment later than the deadline. However, your grade is maximally a 5.5.
- You do not have to ask for permission to hand in an assignment asynchronously.
- No human will grade your asynchronously submitted assignment, hence your grade for style/immutability, etc is automatically 0.  Your grade is completely determined by how many tests you pass. Note that you need to pass all tests in an assignment for a 5.5. For assignment 1, this means that you need to get a base grade of 7. For the other assignments, you need a base grade of 5.5
- Your assignment _is_ checked for plagiarism even when submitted asynchronously.
- For a graded assignment to be counted as synchronously, you have to have handed in previous sub-assignments before the deadline as well. For example, for your 2.3 assignment to be counted as synchronous, you have to have submitted 2.1 and 2.2 before their respective deadlines as well.
- When handing in an assignment asynchronously, you only have to submit the (last) graded assignment in a group. For example, if you submit 2.3 asynchronously, you do not have to submit 2.1 and 2.2.
- You _can_ hand in some assignments synchronously and some asynchronously. For example, you hand in 1,2.1,2.2,2.3 synchronously, 3 asynchronously, and then 4.1 and 4.2 synchronously again.
- If you've failed an assignment, you _can_ resubmit your assignment asynchronously to get a passing grade.
- I submit final grades for this course to VUNet 2 times a year, after the exam and the resit exam. If you submitted your asynchronous assignments before the exam, their results will be taken into account when reporting your final grade after the exam. The same holds for the resit exam. This means that the last moment to submit asynchronous assignments is before the resit exam (which is on Thursday the 12th of January 2023 18:45) 
- You cannot asynchronously submit the bonus assignment.

# Fraud

Do not copy code from each other or from the internet!

It is not allowed (for any course) to publish solutions on github or other websites. The exam board considers this a punishable act of plagiarism, as they define plagiarism as any act that makes a fair assessment impossible. Please make any solutions private.

It is only allowed to publish original game bonus assignments for this course. It is not allowed to publish improved versions of snake or Tetris.

It is allowed to discuss the assignments and solutions broadly.

If you are stuck and want help from a fellow student that already solved it, then it is:

- OK to show your (not-working) code to them and discuss what is wrong.
- NOT OK to look at their (working) code.

The reason here is that the former leads to you understanding what is wrong with your own code, while the latter likely leads to you submitting the same solution as your fellow student.

We automatically check your code for similarities. If we have reason to suspect fraud, we will forward your case to the exam commission.

# Exam

The exam is a digital multiple-choice exam (testvision). It will be held on Thursday, 26th October, 12:15–14:30 on campus (in the TenT).

The resit exam is on Thursday the 10th of January 2023 18:45

Partially correct answers are taken into account when scoring. [Exact details here.](https://discuss.ridl.eu/t/exam-logistic-question-are-partially-correct-answers-taken-into-consideration/1560/3)
