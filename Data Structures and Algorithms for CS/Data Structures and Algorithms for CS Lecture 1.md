> [!summary]+ Algorithms
> - An algorithm is an unambiguous description of how to tranform an input to an output
> - bake a cake, knit a sweater, sort a sequence
> - An algoirthm is a tool for solving a computational problem
> - Solve the sorting problem, decide membership of a set
> - We will see many examples of algorithms
> - Having seen many examples helps us to define our own algorithms

> [!summary]+ Data structures
> - A data structure is a way to store and organize data
> - bookshelves, array, list, stack, queue
> - In many cases we wish to query and to update
> - we aim to understand the strengths and limitations
> - We will see a few data structures
> - We will use the array starting at index 1

## Data stuructures andn algorithms context
- some problems cannot be solved
  Halting problem
- some problems cannot be solved efficiently
  Hanoi
- some problems can be solved efficiently
  sorting, [[Shortest path]]
- for some problems we do not know whether they can be (efficiently) solved
  Collatz
  
## Some important aspects of algorithms
- **algorithm:** an algorithm is a list of instructions, the essence of a program
- **correctness:** does the algorithm for every input halt with correct output?
- **termination:** does the algorithm eventually produce an output?
- **time complexity**
- **space complexity** *asdf*
