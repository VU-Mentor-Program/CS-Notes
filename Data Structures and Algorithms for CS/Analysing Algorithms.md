# Worst-case and average-case analysis
- The worst-case running time of an algorithm gives us an upper bound on the running time for any input
- For some algorithms, the worst case occurs fairly often.
  The search algorithms' worst case will often occur when the information is not present in the database
- the "average case" is often roughly as bad as the worst case
# Order of growth
- We consider only the leading term of a formula (e.g. $an^2$) since the lower-order terms are relatively insignificant for large values of $n$.
- We write that insertion sort has a worst-case running time of $\Theta(n^2)$ (pronounced "theta of $n$-squared").
