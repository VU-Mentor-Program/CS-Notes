# Radix sort
> [!definition]+
> Radix sort avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix.
> For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered.

- sorting numbers considered as tuples
- number of columns: (fixed) amount of digits used
- number of places: 10 for decimal numbers

**Intuition**: sort per dimension using a [[Sorting#Stable Sorting|stable sorting]] algorithm
- sorting on the *least significant digit* first
- using a stable underlying sorting algorithm
```cpp
Radix-sort(A,d)
	for i = 1 to d
		use a stable sort to sort array A on digit i
```
# Bucketsort
- assumes that the input is drawn from a uniform distribution
- average-case running time: $O(n)$
- divides the interval \[0,1) into $n$ equal-sized subintervals and then distributes the $n$ input numbers into the buckets
```cpp
Bucket-sort(A)
	let B[0..n-1] be a new array
	n = A.length
	for i = 0 to n - 1
		make B[i] an empty list
	for i = 1 to n
		insert A[i] into list B [[nA[i]]]
	for i = 0 to n - 1
		sort list B[i] with insertion sort
	concatenate the lists B[0],B[1],...,B[n - 1] together in order
```
# [[Stack|Stacks]] and queues
## Stack
- If `S.top` = 0, the stack is empty
- If we attempt to pop an empty stack, the stack *underflows*
- If `S.top` exceeds $n$, the stack *overflows*

## Queue 
**Queue**: first-in, first-out (*FIFO*)
- the queue has a head and a tail
- an element is enqueued by taking its place at the tail (`Q.tail`)
- an element is dequeued by removing the element at the head (`Q.head`)
- If `Q.head` = `Q.tail`, the list is empty
- If `Q.head`= `Q.tail`+1, the queue is full
# Linkedlist
- objects are arranged in a linear order
- order is detemined by a pointer in each object (not indices)
- **doubly linked list**: each object has an attribute *key* and two pointer attributes *next* and *prev*
- if `x.next = NIL` -> element `x`has no successor -> *tail*
- if `L.head = NIL` -> list is empty
- **circular list**: tail.next points to head, and head.prev points to tail
- **Insert an element in a doubly linked list**: let the next point to the head of a list -> $O(1)$
- **search for a key in a doubly linked list**: walk through the list until we find the key or exit the list -> $\Theta(n)$ worst-case
- **delete an element from a doubly linked list**: rearrange the pointers of the elements before and after -> $O(1)$ for element x
  If we are given the key and first have to search for the element x with the key: $\Theta(n)$
## Sentinels
> [!definition]+
> A dummy object that allows us to simplify boundary conditions

- represents `NIL` but has all attributes of other objects in the list
- regular doubly linked list turns into a **circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel** (sentinel lies between head and tail)
