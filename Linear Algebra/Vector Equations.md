# Vectors in $\Bbb R^2$
- The set of all vectors with two entries is denoted by $\Bbb R^2$ 
	- each entry is a real number $\Bbb R$
	- exponent 2 indicates that each vector contains two entries
- the sum of two vectors $u$ and $v$ is the vector $u+v$ obtained by adding corresponding entries
- given a real number $c$, the **scalar multiple** of $u$ by $c$ is the vector $cu$ obtained by multiplying each entry in $u$ by $c$

> [!example]- Scalar multiplication and vector addition
> Given $u=\begin{bmatrix}1\\-2\end{bmatrix}$ and $v = \begin{bmatrix}2\\-5\end{bmatrix}$ find $4u+(-3)v$
> $$4u=\begin{bmatrix}4\\-8\end{bmatrix}, \qquad (-3)v=\begin{bmatrix}-6\\15\end{bmatrix}$$ and $$4u+(-3)v=\begin{bmatrix}4\\-8\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}-6\\15\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-2\\7\end{bmatrix}$$

# Geometric Descriptions of $\Bbb R^2$
- we can identify a geometric point $(a,b)$ with the column vector $\begin{bmatrix}a\\ b\end{bmatrix}$ -> $\Bbb R^2$ is the set of all points in the plane
- **Parallelogram Rule for Addition**: 
  If $u$ and $v$ and $\Bbb R^2$ are represented as points in the plane, then $u+v$ corresponds to the fourth vertex of the parallelogram whose other vertices are $u$, $0$, and $v$
# Vectors in $\Bbb R^n$
- $\Bbb R^n$ denotes the collection of all lists of $n$ real numbers
- **zero vector** has zero in every entry

> [!abstract] Algebraic Properties of $\Bbb R^n$
> For all $u$, $v$, $w$ in $\Bbb R^n$ and all scalars $c$ and $d$: 
> 1. $u+v = v+u$
> 2. $(u+v) + w = u + (v+w)$
> 3. $u+\vec 0 = \vec 0 + u = u$
> 4. $u+(-u) = -u + u = 0$, where $-u$ denotes $(-1)u$
> 5. $c(u+v) = cu+cv$
> 6. $(c+d)u=cu+du$
> 7. $c(du)=(cd)u$
> 8. $1u=u$

- Proof of vector addition: 
  $$
  u+v=\begin{bmatrix}u_1\\ \vdots \\ u_2\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\ \vdots \\ v_2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}u_1+v_1\\ \vdots \\ u_n+v_n\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}v_1+u_1\\ \vdots \\ v_n+u_n\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\ \vdots \\ v_2\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}u_1\\ \vdots \\ u_2\end{bmatrix}=v+u
  $$
# Linear Combinations
- Given vectors $v_1, v_2,...,v_p$ in $\Bbb R^n$ and given scalars $c_1,c_2,...,c_p$ the vector $y$ is a **linear combination**: $$y=c_1v_1+\cdots +c_pv_p$$

- A vector equation $$x_1a_1+x_2a_2+\cdots+x_na_n=b$$ has the same solution set as the linear system whose augmented matrix is $$[a_1\quad a_2\quad\cdots\quad a_n\quad b]\tag 1$$ In particular, $b$ can be generated by a linear combination of $a_1,...,a_n$ if and only if there exists a solution to the linear system corresponding to the matrix $(1)$

> [!definition] Span
> If $v_1,...,v_p$ are in $\Bbb R^n$ then the set of all linear combinations of $v_1,...,v_p$ is denoted by Span$\{v_1,...,v_p\}$ and is called the **subset of $\Bbb R^n$ spanned by $v_1,...,v_p$**. That is, Span $\{v_1,...,v_p\}$ is the collection of all vectors that can be written in the form $$c_1v_1+c_2v_2+\cdots+c_pv_p$$ with $c_1,...,c_p$ scalars.

# A Geometric Description of Span{v} and Span {u,v}
- Let $v$ be a nonzero vector in $\Bbb R^3$. Then Span$\{v\}$ is the set of all scalar multiples of $v$, which is the set of points on the line in $\Bbb R^3$ through $v$ and $0$.

- If $u$ and $v$ are nonzero vectors in $\Bbb R^3$, with $v$ not a multiple of $u$, then Span$\{u,v\}$ is the plane in $\Bbb R^3$ that contains $u$, $v$, and $0$. In particular, Span$\{u,v\}$ contains the line in $\Bbb R^3$ through $u$ and $0$ and the line through $v$ and $0$
