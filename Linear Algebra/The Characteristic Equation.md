> Let $A$ and $B$ be $n\times n$ matrices.
> 1. $A$ is invertible iff $\text{det }A\neq 0$
> 2. $\text{det }AB=(\text{det }A)(\text{det }B)$
> 3. $\text{det }A^T=\text{det }A$
> 4. If $A$ is triangular, then $\text{det }A$ is the product of the entries on the main diagonal of $A$
> 5. A row replacement operation on $A$ does not change the determinant. A row interchange changes the sign of the determinant. A row scaling also scales the determinant by the same scalar factor.

# The Characteristic Equation
- A scalar $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ iff $\lambda$ satisfies the characteristic equation $$\text{det}(A-\lambda I)=0$$

> [!tip] Reasonable Answers
> Row reduce $A-\lambda I$. If every column is a pivot column, then the scalar $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$ (since $A-\lambda I$ would be invertible and the determinant would not be 0!)
- $\text{det }(A-\lambda I)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ called the **characteristic polynomial** of $A$
- The **multiplicity** of an eigenvalue $\lambda$ is its multiplicity as a root of the characteristic equation
# Similarity
- $A$ **is similar to** $B$ if there is an invertible matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP=B$

> [!info] THEOREM 4
> If $n\times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are similar, then they have the same characteristic polynomial and hence the same eigenvalues (with the same multiplicities)
