- Let $A$ and $B$ be square matrices. If $AB=IA$, then $A$ and $B$ are both invertible, with $B=A^{-1}$ and $A=B^{-1}$.
# Invertible Linear Transformations
> [!info] THEOREM 9
> Let $T:\Bbb R^{n}\to\Bbb R^{n}$ be a linear transformation and let $A$ be the standard matrix for $T$. Then $T$ is invertible iff $A$ is an invertible matrix. In that case, the linear transformation $S$ given by $S(x)=A^{-1}x$ is the unique function satisfying equations $$S(T(x))=x \qquad\text{for all } x \text{ in } \Bbb R^n$$ $$T(S(x))=x \qquad\text{for all } x \text{ in } \Bbb R^n$$
