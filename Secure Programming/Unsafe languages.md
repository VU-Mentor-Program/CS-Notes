Unsafe languages rely on the programmer to allocate and deallocate memory. It is often used for 
- Performance-critical code
- having access to lower levels (OS or hardware)
- Resource-constrained embedded systems
- Real-time systems where the performance is less predictable
- or where a lot of **preexisting code exists**

This can lead to problems later on, where security becomes more important, since attackers can take advantage if the programmer makes a mistake.
