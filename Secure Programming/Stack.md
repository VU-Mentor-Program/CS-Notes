**LIFO**: Last-in, First-out
# Basic Operations
- `Push`: Adds data on top of the stack (TOS)
- `Pop`: Removes top of the stack

In computers, the stack starts at the highest memory address and grows downwards to the lowest address. When functions are called, a certain part is reserved which is called a **stack frame**. It stores values such as:
- Function parameters
- Local variables
- Return address - where to continue after return
- Frame pointer - where is caller's stack frame
