- [ ] store data in database running on your own computer
- [ ] functionality:
	- [ ] retrieve full data set (all rows)
	- [ ] CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete)
		- [ ] add data for a new photo item
		- [ ] list data of specific item
		- [ ] change data on specific item
		- [ ] remove data of a specific item
- [ ] over RESTful HTTP 1.1 API
	- [ ] uses most appropriate HTTP 1.1 method for each function if provides
	- [ ] Every HTTP GET is safe
	- [ ] HTTP methods should be **idempotent** (except POST)
	- [ ] response in JSON
	- [ ] should accept JSON data as input
	- [ ] appropriate HTTP header in response
	- [ ] appropriate HTTP response code
# Documentation part
- HTML5 file
- explain the use of the API
	- no installation instructions
- cover CRUD functionality
- endpoint URI of resource involved
	- parameters required in URL or data in HTTP request message
- HTTP methods allowed and reponse codes
- MIME format: resourse in HTTP response message
- example for both input and output for each service
# Implementation part
- use node.js framework
- use sqlite3
	- handle incoming HTTP requests appropriately
# Example SQL queries
retrieve all items
```javascript
db.all("SELECT author, alt, tags, image, description FROM gallery", function(...
```
select single item
```javascript
db.all("SELECT author, alt, tags, image, description FROM gallery WHERE id=" + id, function(...
```
update item with specific id
```javascript
db.run(`UPDATE gallery
					SET author=?, alt=?, tags=?, image=?,
                    description=? WHERE id=?`,
                    [item['author'], item['alt'], item['tags'], item['image'], item['description'], item['id']], function(...
```
inserting new item
```javascript
db.run(`INSERT INTO gallery (author, alt, tags, image, description)
                VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)`,
                [item['author'], item['alt'], item['tags'], item['image'],  item['description']], function(...

## Responses
The response bodies for retrieving the entire database or a single entry includes a JSON object. Error messages are parsed as plain text.

## Accepted JSON data format
The only accepted data format is stringifyed JSON. The JSON object must have the following 5 keys: 'author', 'alt', 'tags', 'image', 'description'. An accpeted JSON format would look like the following: 
```javascript
let entry = {
	author: "Grace Hopper",
	alt: "Image of Berners-Lee"
	tags: "html,http,url,cern,mit"
	image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Sir_Tim_Berners-Lee.jp"
	description: "The internet and the Web aren't the same thing."
