# Getting started with React
- Important react methods:
	- **`ReactDOM.createRoot()`** creates and returns a root DOM node inside the given element. The **root DOM node** is any DOM node that is managed by React
	- **`Root.render()`** renders a React element into the root DOM node. React uses **virtual DOM** to facilitate the rendering of the root DOM node into the browser's DOM
