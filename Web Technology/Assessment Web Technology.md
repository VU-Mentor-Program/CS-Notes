You can earn a maximum of 10 points, which is divided over:

6.0 pt: assignments
The three graded assignments have the same weight. All assignments need to be submitted to pass the course! Each assignment submitted before the deadline is evaluated and receives a grade from 0-100. An assignment submitted after the deadline is evaluated and graded, but 10 out of 100 points will be deducted when you submit within 24 hours after the deadline,  -20 points when you submit within 48hr, etc.
All assignments need to be graded with at least 30 out of 100 points. If one of your assignments is graded below 30, but you did pass the exam, you need to contact the staff after the exam to get an extra replacing assignment.
There are multiple pass/fail assignments: The peer reviews and the GitHub repo setup. All of these need to be passed in order to pass the course.
 3.0 pt: exam (multiple choice)
Warning: If you fail the exam and the resit, lab and/or assignments grades cannot be transferred to next year. This means you need to do the entire course again in the next academic year. Failing the exam and resit also means you cannot do extra replacing assignments for assignments graded below 30.
1.0 pt: ZyBook participation
Students that have successfully done at least 50% of all participation and challenge activities of the mandatory ZyBook sections are entitled for an extra (part of a) point calculated as follows:
(Percentage_completed - 50) * 0.02
This will be measured during the first exam, so all activities you make in preparation before the exam will also help you to earn this point.   The percentage of activities you have completed will be calculated by ZyBook and cannot be discussed.
To pass the course three conditions must be met:

1. All assignments (graded and pass/fail) have been completed satisfactorily.
2. The score of the exam must be 5.5 or higher.
3. The weighted average of the assignments must be 5.5 or higher.

**Bonus**: Students that meet all requirements above, and have attended the lab sessions and worked actively on the assignments and other course materials during the lab sessions will be awarded 0.5 point bonus.

So your final grade will be:

(0.3 * Gradeexam) +
(0.020 * PointsA1) +
(0.020 * PointsA2) +
(0.020 * PointsA3) +
Zybook + 
Bonus

Note that if you fail the exam and resit, you fail the course and your final grade is the same as the grade of your exam.
