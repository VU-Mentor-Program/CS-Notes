In addition, the Reader available on Canvas will provide you with pointers to interesting material online. Most of these come with a short note explaining why we think this material is relevant and how you should use it to your advantage. Understand why material is relevant (or not), and have an informed opinion about the quality is as important as understanding the material itself!

We will go through the overall content of the course again during the final "exam preparation" lecture.

In this course, you will need to understand many different technologies. The following global aspects will help you to better understand what, why and how to approach this.

## Technology ecosystems
In many areas of daily life, innovation proceeds by new technologies replacing older ones. In computing this happens as well, but we often see another type of innovation: new technologies are built on top of existing ones. Over time, this results in a vertical technology stack, with many layers on top of one another. Looking at only the top layer in isolation will give you only superficial insights in how and why things work the way they do. A full understanding of a new technology thus also requires understanding of the layers it is built on.

In addition, we see new technologies co-evolve next to one another, where changes to one affect the other technology as well. Many of the client-side technologies discussed in the first week of the course can be seen as a horizontally grouped set of technologies that are designed to be used together to solve specific problems. The Web can be seen as a technological ecosystem, where a relative large number of technologies need to be understood before one can see the big picture.

In this course, you will need to learn a relative high number of technologies, both old and new, and how they depend on one another.

## Technologies are not laws of nature
Many aspects of any given technology are the result of human labor, and not laws of nature that are merely "discovered" by scientists. Especially when networks are involved, software and hardware products made by different companies often work together because they follow specific formal or informal standards (or fail to do so when not). Standards currently in use are the result of human decision making in the past, and changes to these standards in the future will involve more decision making. Understanding which organisation governs which aspect of Web technology and what their goals and (political) motivations are, is important to understand the current technological landscape and to develop an intuition for future developments in this area.

In this course, you will learn which organizations are involved in governing the various aspects of the Internet and in developing new Web protocols and other relevant standards.

## Broad overview versus deep insights
To understand how the Web works requires you to have an overview of a broad range of technologies and how they interact, and a particular set of skills that allow you to make use of these technologies to solve real world problems. We believe that by acquiring this overview and basic skill set, you will be well equipped to dive deeper into specific aspects of Web technologies in other courses on your own initiative.

Some of you may feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of technologies introduced in this course, and will, initially, feel a bit lost just because of this. Some of you may feel underwhelmed by the lack of depth, and will feel you learned too little on every topic to make the course useful. Some of you will appreciate the balance between breath and depth on some topics, but miss that same balance on other topics.

For all of you, we recommend you increase your knowledge and skill set by seriously studying the material in the zyBook and assignments that are an essential part of this course. For those of you who are new to the topic being discussed:  You will learn that most of the individual  technologies discussed in this course are not that complex: many became successful because of their simplicity. For those of you looking for more deeper insights: Most assignments allow and encourage you to look beyond that first basic level. By doing some targeted search on the Web yourself, you may find that many of these simple technologies remained successful because they were suited to do more than what they were originally designed to do. What are the characteristics of such an enabling technology? While not mandatory, many assignments allow answers on different levels of sophistication, and if you feel a topic is being discussed too superficially during the lecture we encourage you to look for these deeper levels yourself.

# Course Rules
The rules given below apply to all students. Exceptions are only possible in special (e.g. medical) cases, and after explicit agreement from your study adviser.

Study load and credits: Successful completion of the course will be awarded with 6 ECTS credits. Note that 6 ECTS represent 168 study hours, which is a lot for a 4 week course! We thus expect you to work full-time, that is 40 hours a week during these four weeks, with one day (8 hours) of course preparation before the course starts.

You will need this time to make three assignments, study the zyBook and other course material, prepare and attend the (7 x 3 hour) lab sessions, the 12 lectures (2x45min each), and final exam (2 hours).

Lab Attendance: Attendance of all 7 lab sessions is mandatory. If there are compelling reasons for you not to attend, please inform the student assistant of your group in advance through email to the wt.few@listserver.vu.nl. In case of such compelling reasons you are allowed to miss one (1) lab session. Students which have not attended Lab sessions will be required to give a short oral explanation to the student assistant of their answers to the Lab questions. If you miss more than one session, or miss a session without providing a valid reason in advance you will not get your lab attendance bonus for your final mark.

Collaboration: Students do all lab work in groups of two. Exceptions are possible on request (e.g. for medical reasons), but with explicit agreement with the staff. The staff may enforce students to work alone when there is reason to believe the level of one student does insufficiently match that of the other. The mere suspicion of fraud is also a reason to split up the group. Resit students are also required to work alone (see below).

Understand what you do: Students should work together on all assignments (so do not split the work over the two of you), as the assignments are meant to let you explore a subject of the course.

Resit students: Resit students are required to work alone. If you make an assignment that you also made in previous years, you have to make clear what you part you reused and what part you have changed and why. If you find that too much work, you are also allowed to start from scratch, but then you need to make sure you do not reuse anything from previous years.
