# Why do we need user evaluation
- user interface is often the central discriminating factor
- comparison is easily possible
- direct correlation between usability and sales
-> collect and analyze user data and ensure that your users are staying
- generate academic knowledge
# What is usability?
> [!quote]+ 
> Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word 'usability' also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process

## quality components
- **Learnability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
- **Efficiency**: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
- **Memorability**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
- **Errors**: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
- **Satisfaction**: How pleasant is it to use the design?
# Research question (Problem Statement)
- always a question
- sometimes more than one
- has practical and / or theoretical relevance
# Types of studies
- **Explorative (What is related)**:
	- what factors determine if people come back to visit a website a second time?
	- Is there a correlation between characteristics of my visitors and the types of erorors that they make?
- **Descriptive (What happens)**:
	- What percentage of people find my website through google?
	- What percentage by typing in the URL directly?
- **Explanatory (Why does it happen)**:
	- Does the addition of a login function mean that more people come back to my website a second time?
	- Did the revision of the link structure of my website make visitors find what they were looking for quicker?
# How to collect data
- qualitative vs quantitative data
	- Qualitative: non numerical, e.g. words, text, pictures or objects
	- Quantitative: analysis of numerical data
- Data collection methods
	- Observations
	- Focus groups
	- Interviews
	- Surveys
	- Lab experiments
	- Field experiments

# Experiment
> [!quote]+
> An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis.

## Hypothesis operationalization
- describes the assumed relation between at least two variables
- variables can be any attribute or property of humans, objects or systems
- hypotheses have to be measurable
### How to operationalize a hypothesis
- Literature review
	- conensus in a scientific community
		- Efficiency - Task completion time
		- Accuracy - error rate
	- results are comparable
	- might not exist for new concepts
- Define it for your experiment
	- harder to compare to other results
	- unambiguous
## Experiment plan
Independent variable  -> (influences) Dependent variable
- uncontrolled variables (confound variables) influence out experiment
- low-fidelity prototypes
	- check ideas and interaction flow
	- fast, cheap and easy to change
	- users are keen to criticize
	- no real functionality, difficult to identify errors
	- reuse and extending difficult to impossible
- high-fidelity prototype
	- looks & feels like the final product to the user
	- the functionality however is restricted (only certain functions work)
	- desidng team can show how the finished product will look and feel
	- users can use the product in the given tasks and it should behave like the product
	- task efficiency can be predicted based on the prototype
	- time-consuming to implement
	- feedback cnetered around look & feel
	- users can only "use" the implemented funcions
	- less willingness of users to criticize the overall approach
 - between-group design used to compare different designs
 - Analyzing data
	 - quantitative data: descriptive statistics to describe results
	 - qualitative data: text analysis, affinity diagramming
## Surveys
- online survey: adapt questions to previous answers
- collect information about:
	- demographics of visitors
	- needs and preferences of visitors
	- other web sites visited by your visitors
## Heuristics
- experts evaluate based on a clearyl formulated checklist the usability of a website
- small number of expers required; can be partly automated
- no users involved
## User evaluation on the web vs other applications
- mostly unkown user group
- no contorl over confound variables
- limited control over sample
- "real users in a real setting"
- large numbers of participants
- after setting up the experiment, conducting creates only little effort
## Web analytics
- What: records of what happens on a websites
- Goal: to capture visitor data such as number of hits, navigation, conversion rate, number of errors, where did they browser from, which browser, etc.
- How: Every time a request is made to the server of the website, that request is added to the logfile
- Use: amongst many other things: examine traffic patterns by time of day, day of week, referrer, or user agent
- use of logfiles
	- predict where a user will go based on user's navigation history
	- optimize sturcture of web site based on how users navigate
- Pros:
	- many statistics, such as number of clicks, time spend on page, drop off
	- origin of visitors
	- objective measurements
	- data from the actual visitors
	- continuous, real-time feedback
	- trends visible
- Cons:
	- no insight into motivation and opinion of visitor
	- no information on pages that have not been visited
	- dependent on cookies for visitor identification
	- privacy issues
