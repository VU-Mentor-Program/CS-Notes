- Mobile first: A web development approach that advocates first creating a reduced-feature version of a website for mobile users. Then, the developer creates a full-featured website for visitors using desktop computers.
  Because mobile devices are increasingly used everywhere, even at home, developing the mobile-site first is a common approach. In addition, many people do not own desktop computers and only access websites using mobile devices.
- Screen size: Physical dimension in pixels of a device's screen.
  Mobile device screens are much smaller than desktops. Good design requires significant effort to make websites that work well for different screen sizes.
- Affordances: Visual clues that guide the user in figuring out how to use an app.
  Affordances, a term invented by usability expert Donald Norman, are harder to implement for mobile devices. For instance, few mobile devices support a touch screen equivalent of hovering with a mouse. So, hovering-based interfaces like tooltips are unavailable on touch based devices
- Responsive web design: A web design approach that creates webpages that automatically move and resize parts depending on the display size and orientation.
  Responsive web design requires careful design and typically uses software frameworks to simplify development.
