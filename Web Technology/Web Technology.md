## Tips
December 2022-January 2023: Course Preparation
The four course weeks in January are really dense, and there is little room to fix administrative problems once the course has started. This applies especially to students from AUC and from VU faculties other than Exact Sciences (FEW).

Please use the time before to check all items on the following checklist:

Make sure you have a valid VUnet account, have registered for the course and can access the course material on Canvas.
Assignments are made in Lab groups of two persons. So make sure you sign up for a Lab group as soon as possible.
You are encouraged to bring your own laptop during the lab work. If you plan to use the university's computers during the lab sessions, please make sure you have a user account that is valid on the VU lab machines.
## Emails and Resources
Information and Communication
Canvas: All communication from staff to you will go through Canvas. We may update material on Canvas during the course, so please make sure you are looking at the latest version of assignments and other material.

Email: All written communication from you to the staff should be by email and addressed to: wt.few@listserver.vu.nl. We will ignore messages sent to our personal email addresses or through canvas. Your emails should be brief and to the point. Always sign with your full name, group number and student number. If you want to address the question to a particular instructor, then start the subject line of the message with the name of the instructor followed by a colon (:). Note that for security reasons, the VU mail servers are pretty strict when dealing with attachments. For example, ZIP or JavaScript attachments will be stripped from your email, so please do not send such attachments.
