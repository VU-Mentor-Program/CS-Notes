The course material discussed during the lectures is roughly structured into three parts:

1. Internet Basics & Web Markup (HTML, CSS) (first week),
2. Client- & server-side Web application development (second week) and
3. REST, evaluation and societal relevance of Web technologies (third week).

There are no lectures in the fourth week so you can focus on finishing your final assignment and preparing for the exam, which will be scheduled at the end of week four.

The first three weeks are structured around an alternating sequence of two lectures and a three hour lab session. You need to prepare the lectures to be able to follow the discussions, and you need to prepare the lab sessions to be able to ask the right questions. Note that there are assignment deadlines every week, and that these are strict deadlines.

All instructions on assignments and lecture preparations will appear on Canvas during the course. Material posted may be updated anytime. Please check Canvas regularly for updates and make sure you are looking at the most recent version of each page.

## Peer Reviews
After every assignment, you will be asked to peer review the assignment of one of the other groups. This means you will go over the assignment description and rubric, and run the other team's code. You will check whether the other group has implemented everything properly. This process is designed to allow you to learn from other students' mistakes and accomplishments. While the peer review assignments are pass/fail, there is a special bonus per TA group for the team that handed in the most consistently insightful peer reviews.
