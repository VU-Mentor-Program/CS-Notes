npm uses semantic versioning to ensure the correct package version is installed. **Semantic versioning** is a popular software versioning scheme that uses a sequence of three digits: major.minor.patch. Ex: 1.2.3.
- The major number indicates a major version of the package, which adds new functionality and possibly alters how previous functions now work.
- The minor number indicates a minor change to the package, which usually entails bug fixes and minor changes to how the package's functions work.
- The patch number indicates a bug fix to a minor version.
