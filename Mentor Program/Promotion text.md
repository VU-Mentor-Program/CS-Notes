## Weekly Lectures
Good Morning Students! We have something amazing to announce! 🎉

Although you are taught a lot in your courses, there are some crucial skills and tools that students use hundreds of hours over the course of their education, that are left out!! In the next couple of weeks, the mentor team will be hosting lectures for all sorts of topics.
The first lecture will be *next week on Wednesday* 📅 at *13:00* ⏰. We will be show casing how to use *git and Github* for collaborative work and some helpful tools 🛠️. We will also be sharing *_notes_* 🗒️ from the mentors, and a place where you can contribute! (Even if you do know the basics of git, we still recommend that you come). We know that you have to attend to your studies, so we'll try to keep it as brisk as possible. 
Make sure that you at least have _git installed_, since you'll be needing it during the presentation!

The mentor team wishes you all the best with your upcoming exams 🍀!

## Exam prep

Hello Everyone!  
Since this is exam week, we won’t be hosting any study sessions or game nights 😔. To get you ready for your exams, we will have two **_**exam preparations****_ for the _courses _Intro to Python\ _and _Intro to Psychology__.

****Intro to Psychology📚****

_Time **⏰** and date **📆_ : **Thursday 26/10 18:00****

**Room:📍**NU-3A65****  
****Intro to Python**📚**

_Time **⏰** and date **📆_ : **Friday 27/10 15:30****

**Room:📍**NU-3A65****

The python course will have a kahoot quiz 🧐 (Winners might get a prize!). For the psychology course we have a mock exam which we will go over together.  
That’s not all tho, keep your eyes peeled 👀 for the upcoming Halloween event 🎃👻. More information will follow soon‼️

### Disclaimers:
❗DISCLAIMER: This Kahoot! doesn't guarantee at all that (any of) the questions will be on your exam. Anything said by me today cannot be used as an argument when you get a question wrong on the exam. Use this Kahoot! as a way to genuinely practice by not just taking the answers for granted but asking yourself "why". Good luck!❗

Some of you said that the questions 31 and 34 on the Kahoot! might be wrong, so pay careful attention to those.

For any questions regarding the format and the grading system of your coming exam, please go to Canvas or reach out to one of the TA's or the prof. Because we as mentors can NOT know 100%.


## Notes

Hello everyone! As promised, here are the *notes* for the course Pervasive Computing. These notes are a summary of the material covered on the lecture slides from our previous experiences in this course in the last period, and as such the material might have _changed a bit_. Additionally, our notes may leave out some information found on the slides. Therefore, we would like to emphasize that we do not take any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of these notes. They are simply meant to be a *helpful resource for you as you navigate the course material*. Thank you, and best of luck in your studies - the mentor team.

## Email Go-karting

I am reaching out on behalf of the mentor program at Vrije University to inquire about the possibility of organizing a go-karting and laser tag event at your venue, Race Planet, on January 19th or 20th, similar to the event we held last year. We were highly satisfied with the previous event, and we would like the same experience for our first-year students. The details for the previous event are as follows:

We kindly request a similar arrangement for this year's event. Please confirm if the mentioned date is available and provide the total cost and any necessary details for the booking. We also kindly ask if we can get this invoiced by the VU. We are looking forward to the possibility of hosting our event at Race Planet again. Thank you for your attention, and we hope to hear from you soon. 

Best regards,
