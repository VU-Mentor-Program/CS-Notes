# Shell Tools and Scripting

## Shell Scripting
- Assigning variables in bash: `foo=bar`
- Access variable: `$foo`
- strings use `'` and `"`, but using `'` will not substitute
```bash
foo=bar
echo "$foo"
# prints bar
echo '$foo'
# prints $foo
```
- functions:
```bash
mcd () {
    mkdir -p "$1"
    cd "$1"
}
```
List of variables in bash:
- `$0` - Name of the script
- `$1` to `$9` - Arguments to the script. `$1` is the first argument and so on.
- `$@` - All the arguments
- `$#` - Number of arguments
- `$?` - Return code of the previous command
- `$$` - Process identification number (PID) for the current script
- `!!` - Entire last command, including arguments. (Can use `sudo !!`)
- `$_` - Last argument from the last command.

Exit codes can be used to conditionally execute commands using `&&` and `||`.

```bash
false || echo "Oops, fail"
# Oops, fail

true || echo "Will not be printed"
#

true && echo "Things went well"
# Things went well

false && echo "Will not be printed"
#

true ; echo "This will always run"
# This will always run

false ; echo "This will always run"
# This will always run
```

*command substitution* (command outputs can be used as variables): `$( CMD )` 
*process substitution* (command output into temporary file): `<( CMD )`
- example: `diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting program at $(date)" # Date will be substituted

echo "Running program $0 with $# arguments with pid $$"

for file in "$@"; do
    grep foobar "$file" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
        echo "File $file does not have any foobar, adding one"
        echo "# foobar" >> "$file"
    fi
done
```

- compare with `test`

shell *globbing*:

- Wildcards (more later with [[Regex]]) : `?` and `*` to match one or any amount of characters respectively
	- example: files `foo`, `foo1`, `foo2`, `foo10` and `bar`
	  `rm foo?`: will delete `foo1` and `foo2` 
	  `rm foo*`: will delete all but `bar`
- Curly braces `{}`: useful for files with common substrings

```bash
convert image.{png,jpg}
# Will expand to
convert image.png image.jpg

cp /path/to/project/{foo,bar,baz}.sh /newpath
# Will expand to
cp /path/to/project/foo.sh /path/to/project/bar.sh /path/to/project/baz.sh /newpath

# Globbing techniques can also be combined
mv *{.py,.sh} folder
# Will move all *.py and *.sh files


mkdir foo bar
# This creates files foo/a, foo/b, ... foo/h, bar/a, bar/b, ... bar/h
touch {foo,bar}/{a..h}
touch foo/x bar/y
# Show differences between files in foo and bar
diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)
# Outputs
# < x
# ---
# > y
```

- shellcheck LSP for bash/sh scripts
- python script
```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python
import sys
for arg in reversed(sys.argv[1:]):
    print(arg)
```

-  good practice to write shebang lines using the `env`
	- make use of the `PATH` environment variable: `#!/usr/bin/env python`.

## Shell Tools

- tldr pages are more concise and provide examples
### Finding files

- `find`: tool to find files
	- will recursively search for files matching some criteria

```bash
# Find all directories named src
find . -name src -type d
# Find all python files that have a folder named test in their path
find . -path '*/test/*.py' -type f
# Find all files modified in the last day
find . -mtime -1
# Find all zip files with size in range 500k to 10M
find . -size +500k -size -10M -name '*.tar.gz'
```

- perform actions over files that match your query

```bash
# Delete all files with .tmp extension
find . -name '*.tmp' -exec rm {} \;
# Find all PNG files and convert them to JPG
find . -name '*.png' -exec convert {} {}.jpg \;
```

- [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd): a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to `find`
	- colorized output
	- default regex matching
	- Unicode support

- `locate` uses a database that is updated using `updatedb`
	- `updatedb` is updated daily via `cron`

### Finding code

- use `grep` to find files based on file _content_
	- `-C` (Context): print 2 lines before and after search
	- `-v` (Invert): all lines that do not match pattern
	- `-R` (Recursive): searches directories
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) alternative

```bash
# Find all python files where I used the requests library
rg -t py 'import requests'
# Find all files (including hidden files) without a shebang line
rg -u --files-without-match "^#\!"
# Find all matches of foo and print the following 5 lines
rg foo -A 5
# Print statistics of matches (# of matched lines and files )
rg --stats PATTERN
```

### Finding shell commands

- Arrows keys to go back to previous commands
- `history` to show previous commands
	- `histroy | grep find` to search


In most shells, you can make use of `Ctrl+R` to perform backwards search through your history. After pressing `Ctrl+R`, you can type a substring you want to match for commands in your history. As you keep pressing it, you will cycle through the matches in your history. This can also be enabled with the UP/DOWN arrows in [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search). A nice addition on top of `Ctrl+R` comes with using [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Configuring-shell-key-bindings#ctrl-r) bindings. `fzf` is a general-purpose fuzzy finder that can be used with many commands. Here it is used to fuzzily match through your history and present results in a convenient and visually pleasing manner.

Another cool history-related trick I really enjoy is **history-based autosuggestions**. First introduced by the [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell, this feature dynamically autocompletes your current shell command with the most recent command that you typed that shares a common prefix with it. It can be enabled in [zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and it is a great quality of life trick for your shell.

You can modify your shell’s history behavior, like preventing commands with a leading space from being included. This comes in handy when you are typing commands with passwords or other bits of sensitive information. To do this, add `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` to your `.bashrc` or `setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE` to your `.zshrc`. If you make the mistake of not adding the leading space, you can always manually remove the entry by editing your `.bash_history` or `.zsh_history`.

### Directory Navigation

So far, we have assumed that you are already where you need to be to perform these actions. But how do you go about quickly navigating directories? There are many simple ways that you could do this, such as writing shell aliases or creating symlinks with [ln -s](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html), but the truth is that developers have figured out quite clever and sophisticated solutions by now.

As with the theme of this course, you often want to optimize for the common case. Finding frequent and/or recent files and directories can be done through tools like [`fasd`](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) and [`autojump`](https://github.com/wting/autojump). Fasd ranks files and directories by [_frecency_](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421120120/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm), that is, by both _frequency_ and _recency_. By default, `fasd` adds a `z` command that you can use to quickly `cd` using a substring of a _frecent_ directory. For example, if you often go to `/home/user/files/cool_project` you can simply use `z cool` to jump there. Using autojump, this same change of directory could be accomplished using `j cool`.

More complex tools exist to quickly get an overview of a directory structure: [`tree`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree), [`broot`](https://github.com/Canop/broot) or even full fledged file managers like [`nnn`](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) or [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger).

## Exercises

1. Read [`man ls`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html) and write an `ls` command that lists files in the following manner
    
    - Includes all files, including hidden files
    - Sizes are listed in human readable format (e.g. 454M instead of 454279954)
    - Files are ordered by recency
    - Output is colorized
A sample output would look like this
   
```
-rw-r--r--   1 user group 1.1M Jan 14 09:53 baz
drwxr-xr-x   5 user group  160 Jan 14 09:53 .
-rw-r--r--   1 user group  514 Jan 14 06:42 bar
-rw-r--r--   1 user group 106M Jan 13 12:12 foo
drwx------+ 47 user group 1.5K Jan 12 18:08 ..
```
2. Write bash functions `marco` and `polo` that do the following. Whenever you execute `marco` the current working directory should be saved in some manner, then when you execute `polo`, no matter what directory you are in, `polo` should `cd` you back to the directory where you executed `marco`. For ease of debugging you can write the code in a file `marco.sh` and (re)load the definitions to your shell by executing `source marco.sh`.
3. Say you have a command that fails rarely. In order to debug it you need to capture its output but it can be time consuming to get a failure run. Write a bash script that runs the following script until it fails and captures its standard output and error streams to files and prints everything at the end. Bonus points if you can also report how many runs it took for the script to fail.
```
 #!/usr/bin/env bash

 n=$(( RANDOM % 100 ))

 if [[ n -eq 42 ]]; then
    echo "Something went wrong"
    >&2 echo "The error was using magic numbers"
    exit 1
 fi

 echo "Everything went according to plan"
```
4. As we covered in the lecture `find`’s `-exec` can be very powerful for performing operations over the files we are searching for. However, what if we want to do something with **all** the files, like creating a zip file? As you have seen so far commands will take input from both arguments and STDIN. When piping commands, we are connecting STDOUT to STDIN, but some commands like `tar` take inputs from arguments. To bridge this disconnect there’s the [`xargs`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html) command which will execute a command using STDIN as arguments. For example `ls | xargs rm` will delete the files in the current directory.
   
   Your task is to write a command that recursively finds all HTML files in the folder and makes a zip with them. Note that your command should work even if the files have spaces (hint: check `-d` flag for `xargs`).
   
   If you’re on macOS, note that the default BSD `find` is different from the one included in [GNU coreutils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands). You can use `-print0` on `find` and the `-0` flag on `xargs`. As a macOS user, you should be aware that command-line utilities shipped with macOS may differ from the GNU counterparts; you can install the GNU versions if you like by [using brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/coreutils).
5. (Advanced) Write a command or script to recursively find the most recently modified file in a directory. More generally, can you list all files by recency?
